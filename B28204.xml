            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is not perhaps any one amongst all the Ancient <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, whose Writings have met with a more general Applause, than those of <hi>Plutarch;</hi> neither has the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, they have gain'd, been undeserv'd, For, whether we consider his <hi>Biography,</hi> in which the <hi>Lives</hi> of the Noblest Heroes, both of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> are most exactly record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and most accurately compar'd; or, whether we regard those excellent Precepts of <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> admirably deliver'd in his other Treatises; we every where find somewhat so great and inimitable, that it plainly shews him to have wanted nothing, but the Knowledge of a purer Religion, to have render'd him one of the best, as well as the most learned Men of his Age. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore, if most Nations have desir'd to
<pb facs="tcp:46328:3"/> enjoy in their own Language the Works of so celebrated an Author: Wherefore, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify those of our Country, who are no less ambitious of that Satisfaction than their Neighbours, several learned and ingenious Gentlemen have employ'd some part of their Time in cloathing him with an <hi>English</hi> Dress. His <hi>Lives</hi> were first taken in Hand, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of which in five Volumes having been well accepted, it encourag'd the Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his <hi>Morals;</hi> the Fifth and last Volume whereof being now compleated, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested in the Name of all the Gentlemen, concern'd in it's Traduction, to lay it at Your Lordships Feet.</p>
            <p>The complying with this Request, my Lord, I must ingeniously confess, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd with no small Earnestness to avoid, the Consciousness of my Insufficiency, making me tremble at the very Thoughts of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before so discerning a Judge; but when I found that no Excuses would be admitted, I, Coward-like, emboldned my self by the Consideration, that you are no less conspicuous for Goodness and Clemency, than for those many other singular Endowments, both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and acquir'd, which have deservedly rais'd your Lordship to so eminent a Dignity in the <hi>English</hi> Church and Nation.</p>
            <p>Be pleas'd then, my Lord, favorably to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Tribute, paid to Your Vertues by
<pb facs="tcp:46328:3"/> the Translators of this Part of our Authors Works, and with your wonted Charity to pardon all such Errors and Imperfections, as Your well known Skill in all sorts of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages cannot but find in the Version of a Writer, the hight of whose Conceptions, 'tis difficult, not to say impossible, to transfer into another Language, without very much abating their Spirit. The Patronage, You shall vouchsafe to afford these our Endeavors, as it will be a more than sufficient Protection against the Cavils and Calumnies of carping and malicious Critics, so will it lay a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Obligation on us to have a constant and grateful Remembrance of so signal a Benefit, in which none shall more faithfully persist, than he, who is, with all imaginable Respect and Submission,</p>

For some there are, who, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with some great and illustrious Action, but which requires a couragious Boldness, do, like to those, that from a far extended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory lanch forth into the Deep, steer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46328:14"/> into the very midst of publick Affairs, thinking <hi>Pindar</hi> to have been in the right, when he said:

                     <l>If you a stately Fabrick do design,</l>
                     <l>Be sure, that your Works Front with Lustre shine.</l>
                  </q> For both the Multitude do thrÃ´ a certain Satiety and Loathing of those,<note place="margin">1. He would have one behave himself so vertuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his Entrance, that his Ill-willers should be constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make him way.</note> to whom they have been accustom'd, more readily receive a Beginner, as the Beholders do a [fresh-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring] Combatant, and the Dignities and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, which have a splendid and speedy Encrease, [dazle and] astonish Envy: For neither does that Fire, as <hi>Ariston</hi> says, make a Smoak, nor that Glory breed Envy, which suddenly and quickly shines forth; but of those, who grow up slowly and by degrees, some are attack'd on this side, others on that: whence many have wither'd away about the Tribunal, before ever they came to flourish. But when, as they say of <hi>Ladas,</hi>

                  </q> Any one suddenly and gloriously performs an Embassy, triumphs, or leads forth an Army, neither the Envious, nor the Disdainful, have like Power over them, [as over others.] Thus did <hi>Aratus</hi> ascend to Glory, making the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of the Tyrant <hi>Nicocles</hi> his first step to the Management of the Common-weal: Thus did <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> setling the Alliance with the <hi>Mantineans</hi> against the <hi>Lacedaemonians.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46328:14"/> Pompey</hi> also requir'd a Triumph, being not yet admitted into the Senat, and when <hi>Sylla</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it, he said to him: <hi>More adore the rising, than the setting Sun:</hi> which when <hi>Sylla</hi> heard, he yielded to him. And the People of <hi>Rome</hi> on a sudden, contrary to the ordinary Course of the Law, declar'd <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> Consul, when he stood Candidate for the Aedileship, not from any vulgar Beginning, but admiring the Victory, he had got, whilst he was yet but a Youth, in a single Combat, fought in <hi>Spain,</hi> and his Gests a little after, perform'd at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> when he was a Tribune [or Colonel] of Foot, in respect of which, <hi>Cato</hi> the Elder cry'd out with a loud Voice:
<q>He only's wise, the rest like Shadows fly.</q> Now then,<note place="margin">2. Let him consider, that there is every where Work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough cut out for Men of Courage.</note> since the Affairs of the Cities have neither Wars to be manag'd, Tyrannies to be overthrown, nor Leagues and Alliances to be treated, what can any one undertake for the Beginning of an illustrious and splendid Government? There are yet left publick Causes and Ambassies to the Emperor, which require the Courage and Prudence of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and cautious Person: There are also in the Cities many good [and laudable Usages] neglected, which being restor'd, and many ill Practices, brought in by Custom, to the Disgrace or Dammage of the City, which being redress'd, may gain him the Esteem of the People. Moreover, a great Suit rightly determin'd, Fidelity in defending a poor Mans Cause against a powerful Adversary, and Freedom of Speech in behalf of Justice to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46328:15"/> some unjust Nobleman, have afforded some a glorious Entrance into the Administration of the State. Not a few also have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd by Enmity [and Quarrels,] having set themselves to attack such Men, whose Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was either envy'd or terrible.

For when the multitude, having outrag'd some good Man, soon after, as it [frequently] happens, repent of their Indignation, they think that way of excusing this Offence the easiest, which is indeed the justest, to wit, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of him, who was the Perswader and Author of it. But the rising up to humble and pull down a wicked Person, who has by his Audaciousness and Cunning subjected the City to himself (such as heretofore <hi>Cleon</hi> and <hi>Clitophon</hi> were in <hi>Athens</hi>) makes a glorious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the Management of publick Affairs, as it were to a Play.<note place="margin">4.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46328:30"/> one of these three Evils.

For to a Man of great Authority in a City his accompanying and attending on the Magistrate is a greater Grace, than if he were himself accompany'd and attended on by him: or rather this indeed brings Trouble and Envy; but that real Glory, and such, as proceeds from [Kindness and] Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.

But if the Multitude, taking occasion from some [solemn] Feast of the Countrey, or the Veneration of some God, shall be inclin'd, either to exhibit some Shew, to make some small Distribution, to bestow some courteous Gratification, or to perform some other Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, let them in such Matters have an Enjoyment both of their Liberality and Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. For there are many [Examples of] such things in the Governments of <hi>Pericles</hi> and <hi>Demetrius:</hi> and <hi>Cimon</hi> adorn'd the Market-place by planting Rows of Plane-Trees, and making of Walks. <hi>Cato</hi> also, seeing the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulacy in the Time of <hi>Catilines</hi> Conspiracy put in a Commotion by <hi>Caesar,</hi> and dangerously inclin'd to [make] a Change in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perswaded the Senate to decree some Distributions of Money amongst the Poor, and this, being done, appeas'd the Tumult, and quieted the Sedition.<note place="margin">2.

'Tis not amiss also dextrously to transfer, what is

For [the Statue of] a Trumpeter or Halbardier is not commended [or esteem'd] for [the Sake of the Person,] whom it is made [to represent,] but [of the Workman,] by whom it is made. And <hi>Cato,</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> was in a manner fill'd with Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, would not suffer his to be erected, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I had rather, Men should ask, why my Statue is not set up, than why it is.</hi> For such things are subject to Envy, and the People think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves oblig'd to those, who have not receiv'd

For as he does no great or glorious Act, who, having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger sail'd along the [Gulf] <hi>Syrtis,</hi> is afterwards cast away in the Harbor: so he, who having kept himself safe in passing thrÃ´ the Treasury, and the [Management of the] publick Revenues, is caught with a Presiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or a Place in the<note n="*" place="margin">A Place in the Castle of <hi>Athens,</hi> where those, who had done the State any singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, had their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et at the Cities Cost, which was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Honor.</note>
                  <hi>Prytanaeum,</hi> dashes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed against an high Promontory, but is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise drown'd. He then is best, who desires none of these things, but shuns and refuses them all. But if perhaps it is not easie whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to decline a Favor or Testimonial of the Peoples Amity, when they are fully bent to bestow it, as on those, who have in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the State contended not for Silver or Presents, but have fought a Fight truly sacred, and deserving a Crown, let an Inscription, a Tablet, a Decree, or a Branch [of Lawrel or Olive] suffice, such, as <hi>Epimonides</hi> receiv'd out of the <hi>Acropolis</hi> [or Castle of <hi>Athens</hi>] for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purify'd the City. So <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting back the other Honors, that were given him, desir'd, that on the Day of his Death, the Children might have leave to play and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Studies: and to the seven <hi>Persians,</hi> who kill'd the <hi>Magi,</hi> 'twas granted, that they and their Posterity should wear their <hi>Tiara,</hi> [or Turbant] on the Fore part of the Head: for this, it seems, they had made the Signal, when they went about that Attempt. The Honor also, which <hi>Pittacus</hi> receiv'd, had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing political: for being bid to take, what Portion he would, of the Land, he had
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46328:36"/> gotten for his Citizens, he accepted as much, as he could reach with the Cast of his Dart: So <hi>Cocles</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> took as much, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, being lame, could plow in a Day. For the Honor should not be a Recompence of the Action, but an Acknowledgment, that it may continue also long, as those did, which we have mention'd. But of the three hundred Statues, erected to <hi>Demetrius Phalereus,</hi> not one was eaten into by Rust, or cover'd with Filth, they being all pull'd down, whilst him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was yet alive; and those of <hi>Demades</hi> were melted into [Close-stool-pans and] Chamber-pots. Many other Honors also have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the like Fate, being regarded with an ill Eye, not only for the Wickedness of the Receiver, but also for the Greatness of the Gift. A Moderation in the Expence is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the best and surest Preservative of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors: for such as are great, immense and pondrous, are like to unproportion'd Statues, soon overthrown.</p>

And as himself ought to take care for this, so should he advertise others, that private Disturbances are the Occasion of publick ones, and little of great ones, if they are neglected, and suffer'd to proceed without tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care to apply fit Remedies to them in the Beginning.<note place="margin">A notable Example in <hi>Crates.</hi>

For as <hi>Cato</hi> says,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46328:42"/> by Attention and Carefulness great Matters are made little, and little ones reduc'd to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Now there is no better Artifice of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging Men to this, than the shewing himself easily pacify'd in his own private Differences, persisting without Rancor in Matters of the first importance, and managing none with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, contending Wrath, or any other Passion, which may work Sharpness or Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness in necessary Disputes. For as they bind certain round Muffles about the Hands of those, who combat at Buffets, that in their Contests there may not arrive any fatal Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Blows being soft, and such, as can do no great Harm: So in such Suits and Processes with ones Fellow Citizens, 'tis best to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Dispute by making use of pure and simple Pretences, and not by sharpning and empoisoning Matters, as if they were Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, with Calumnies, Malice, and Threats, to render them pernicious, great and publick. For he, who in this manner carries himself with those, with whom he has Affairs, will have others also subject to him. But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about publick Matters, where private Grudges are taken away, are soon appeas'd, and bring no difficult or fatal Mischiefs.</p>

For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more powerful then custom to win upon the wild affections of Man, and to draw him from extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to moderation. But I know not how it comes to pass, that being enter'd into this discourse, we have not only forgot the Subject we were Yesterday upon, but what we had also this day agreed to make the Theme of our Colloquy. For Yesterday, as well you know, having thrown out a Proposition, that all Creatures were in some manner partakers of Understanding and Reason, we gave an occasion to our young Hunts-men for a fair dispute, which of the two excell'd in craft and cunning, the Land-Animals, or the Creatures that breed in the Sea? Which, if you please, we will determin this day, if <hi>Aristodemus</hi> and <hi>Phaedimus</hi> will stand to their Agreement: Of which two Gentlemen, the one has
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46328:51"/> offer'd himself to his Friends to be the Patron of the Land-Animals, the other reserves the honour of being more crafty to those of the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soclares.</hi> They will be as good as their words, I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure ye, <hi>Autobulus,</hi> and will be here presently: For I saw them both early this Morning preparing for the Combat. In the mean time, if you please, before they begin, let us resume something of what was Yesterday not so fully discoursed for want of time, or not so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully argu'd in our Wine, as it ought to have been. For there seem'd a dispute to resound in my Ears from the Philosophers <hi>Portico,</hi> as if immortal were opposite to mortal, incorruptible to corruptible, incorporeal to corporeal; and in like manner that things void of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ought to be oppos'd to those Beings that are endu'd with reason, least among so many Connexions this alone should be found maim and imperfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Autobulus.</hi> Good now, Friend <hi>Soclar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> who was he that put such a question, as if that because there are certain Beings endu'd with reason, therefore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing void of reason? For we abound with Examples in all things that are destitute of a Soul; nor do we want any other <hi>Antithesis</hi> to Irrational, but only to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose whatever is depriv'd of a Soul, as being void of Reason and Understanding, to that which is endu'd with Reason and Understanding together with a Soul. But if any one will assert, that Nature is not defective, and therefore that every Animated Nature is partly rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, partly without Reason, another may at the same time alledge, that every Animated Nature is partly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with imagination, partly depriv'd of it; partly sensible, partly insensible; to the end that Nature may not want these opposite Habits and Privations, as it were equally ballanc'd in the same Kind. For if it be absur'd to doubt whether some Living Creatures are sensible, others without Sence, it is as equally ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46328:51"/> to grant Imagination to some Living Creatures and not allow it to others; in regard there is no Living Creature that comes into the World, but what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently endu'd with Sence and Imagination. And thus would he be as much out of the way, who should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire one Living Creature to be rational, another to be void of Reason, distingushing between Men, as if he that had a share of Sense, did not also pertake of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; or that there were any Living Creature, from which a certain sort of Opinion and Ratiocination, otherwise called Sense and Natural Instinct, were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. For Nature, which, as they truly say, made all things for the sake of some thing, and to some end, did not make a sensible Creature to be meerly sensible in bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffering, but to be sensible of many things as familiar and agreeable, and of other things as baneful and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Nor can we omit, that without any teaching or instruction, they avoid some things, and covet the use and benefit of others. Sense it is therefore that affords to every Creature the distinction both of useful and hurtful; which eschewing or making choice of things profitable, and discerning and avoiding of things pernicious or troublesom by the Force of Sense can never be thought to reside in any Creature not capable to reason, to judge, remember and consider. Therefore if you will deprive the Creatures of Expectation, Memory, Design, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, Hope, Fear and Grief, you must at the same time deny them the use either of Eyes or Ears, as not having any manner of Sense or Imagination; which it is better for them to be without, then to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under grief and pain; to which they can never be Subject, if utterly depriv'd of Sense.</p>
               <p>There is an Oration of <hi>Strat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> the Phylosopher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating that without Sense there can be no Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. For many times Letters cursorily glanc'd upon by the Eye, and Speeches little regarded by the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46328:52"/> Ear, forsake our knowledge, but are entertain'd by those that are more attentive. Afterwards by Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection the same things return into our minds, for us to dispose and pursue the Dictates of our own thoughts as we please our selves. Whence we say proverbially, <hi>the Mind sees, the Mind hears,</hi> all other things are Deaf and Blind, in regard there can be no Sense in in the Eyes and Ears, if understanding be wanting. Therefore King <hi>Cleomenes</hi> after great Commendations given to a Copy of Verses recited at a Banquet where he was present, being ask'd whether it were not an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Piece, bid them that heard it give their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that his Mind was in the <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of necessity whatever Creatures are capable of Sense and Understanding, can no otherwise be sensible then by the Force of Understanding.</p>
               <p>But suppose we should grant that Sense has no need of the Understanding for the performance of the Duty incumbent upon it, nevertheless, when that same Sense which makes a difference between what is grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and what is averse to Nature is wanting in a Living Creature, where is that retention of the memory, that dread of things abominated, that desire of things use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and profitable? which being absent, how comes it to pass that they are endu'd with that activity and foresight to provide Receptacles, and places of refuge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to look out after their Prey, and to avoid the Snares and Ginns of the Hunters? And yet those very Authors inculcate these things in their Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even to the teizing our Ears; defining purpose to be an Indication of perfection; Aggression to be an Act of violence, before an Act of violence; Preparation to be an Action before an Action: Memory to be the comprehension of some certain past Axiom which at first was apprehended by Sense. In all which things there is nothing which may not rightly be said to partake
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46328:52"/> of Reason, and yet all these things are common to all Creatures: As indeed are certainly all those things, which refer to cogitation, which, while they lye conceal'd in the Brain, we call thoughts; but when they come to be in motion, we name the Acts of Thought; acknowledging in the mean time all passions and perturbations of the Mind to be false Judgments and erroneous Opinions. So that it is a wonder to me, that the same Men should over-see so many Operations and Motions, some of Desire, others of Fear; nay by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> many times of Envy and Emulation it self. And many times they themselves punish their Dogs and Horses, when they commit a Fault, and this not to no purpose, but to chastise them, by causing in them that same trouble of mind, which, being the effect of pain, we call Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Now the tickling the Ear by pleasing Sounds is call'd, <hi>Kelesis:</hi> But the bewitching the Eye is call'd <hi>Goeteia.</hi> Both which we make use of in the Domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of Wild Beasts. Harts and Horses are allur'd by the Sounds of Pipes and Flutes. And there are a sort of Crabs, which are charm'd out of their holes by Flage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets made of Lote-tree-wood; and 'tis reported that the Shadd-fish are drawn to shew themselves above Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by singing and clapping of hands. The <hi>Otus</hi> also, which is a Bird not much unlike a Night-Raven, is taken by allurement of the sight; for that while he stands staring upon the Fowlers Dancing before him in Measure and Figure, and out of Affectation will be striving to Act his Part, by aping their Motions with his Wings and Shoulders, he is frequently surpriz'd and taken.</p>
               <p>But as for those, that more foolishly affirm, that Beasts are neither affected with joy, nor anger nor fear; that the Nightingale or rather the Swallow does not build, that the Bee does not remember, that the Lion is not angry, that the Hart is not timorous, I would
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46328:53"/> fain know, what answer they will make to those who say, that Beasts neither see nor hear, but as it were see, and as it were hear; that they neither neigh nor bleat, but as it were send forth a certain sound; lastly that they do not absolutely live, but live as it were? For in my Opinion to aver this is as contrary to plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, as the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soclares.</hi> Well then, <hi>Autobulus,</hi> suppose me to be one of those that affirm these things. For to say truth, while Men will be comparing the Actions of Beasts with the customs, actions and manner of living of Men, and yet deny that the same Beasts have the least Inclination or aim at any progress toward Vertue, to which we bent our discourse, I doubt whether Nature gave them a Beginning or no, since they are so uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to attain the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Autobulus,</hi> Why truly, <hi>Soclares,</hi> this is not a thing that seems so absurd to those Men. For that while they assert the Extream love of Parents toward their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be the Principle of Society and Justice, and find at the same time this vertue apparent and surpassing in brute Animals, yet they will not allow them in the least to partake of Justice. Like Mules, which though they are furnished with Genital Parts, as wanting neither Privities nor Wombs, and mixing with delight and pleasure, yet cannot attain the end of Generation. But then again I would have you consider, whether they be not as ridiculous, that affirm <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> to be no less vitious then the meanest of Slaves; nay more, that they were Fools, intemperate and unjust; and then they find fault with the Nature of Beasts, as being impure, and no way accurately fram'd for the Reception of Vertue. As if the depravedness and imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of reason, were not vices of Reason, of which all brute Beasts are Guilty; the most of which we plainly find to be intemperate, fearful and unjust. Therefore he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46328:53"/> perfection of reason in a Creature not framed by nature to receive and entertain it, little differs from one that should deny a Monkey to partake of deformity by nature, or a Tortoise of slowness, as being neither suscep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of beauty or swiftness. Nor do they observe the Distinction that lyes before their Eyes. For reason is in the Creature by nature, but right and perfect reason is attain'd by Industry and Education; so that naturally all Creatures may be said to be rational. But if they look for perfection of reason, and true wisdom, they will hardly find those perfections in any Man whatever. For as there is a difference between sight and sight; and between flight and flight (for Haws and Grashoppers do not see alike neither do Eagles and Patridges flye with equal swiftness) so neither in all rational Creatures is there to be, found the same Perfection of cunning and acuteness. For as there are many Examples to be produc'd of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Brute Creatures, excelling in the Observance of Society, Fortitude, and Foresight as to their particular Oeconomy, and making Provision for themselves; so on the other side, there may be found among them, as many of Injustice, Cowardice and Folly. Which is evident from the present Contest, wherein these Young Gentleman have engag'd themselves, while the one has undertaken to maintain that Land-Animals, the other, that Creatures bred in the Sea, are most enclin'd to Vertue. Which is plainly demonstrated by comparing of River-Horses with Storks. For the one supports and cherishes their Parents, if they may be so call'd; the other kills them that they may enjoy their Damms. So likewise if you compare Doves with Patridges. For the Cock Patridge will not suffer the Hen to sit, but breaks her Eggs, and bangs her out of her Nest, refusing to be trod. But the Cock Pigeon takes upon him part of the Females duty, in brooding over the Eggs and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>oung ones; and if the Hen happen to be too long absent, corrects her with his Bill, till he forces
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46328:54"/> her to return to her Nest. So that while <hi>Antipater</hi> found fault with Sheep and Asses for their nastiness, I wonder, how he came to pass by the <hi>Lynx</hi> and the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; of which the one are so cleanly, that they always remove and hide their Excrements, the other teaches her Young ones to turn their Tayles out of their Nest, before they let fall their defilement. And indeed why may we not say, that one Tree is more docible then another, as Dogs are more docible then Sheep, or one Pot-herb more timorous then another, as Harts are more fearful then Lyons. Or otherwise, as among things immoveable, there is not one thing slower in Motion then another, nor among things, that are mute, one thing more vocal then another, so neither among things to which nature has not afforded a faculty of understanding, is there one thing more timorous, more sloathful, or more intemperate then another; But as to those Creatures where that faculty is present, the difference is manifest in the degrees of more or less.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soclares.</hi> However 'tis a wonderful thing to observe, how much Man differs from all other Creatures in probity of Manners, in Industry, and all those things, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Justice and common Society.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Autobulus.</hi> Nevertheless, my dear friend, this cannot be deny'd, that there are many brute Beasts that surpass Men both in bulk and swiftness, others that far surpass him in strength of sight, and exactness of Hearing: and yet for all this we are not to say, that Man is blind, without strength, or wants Ears: for nature has not depriv'd us either of Hands or Eyes, or strength, or bulk, though we must not compare with Camels or Elephants. In like manner we must not say, that brute Beasts are altogether depriv'd of reason and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because they are more dull of understanding, and not so quick at ratiocination as we are; as only enjoying a weak and muddy sort of Reason, like a dim and clouded Eye. And did I not presently expect these
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46328:54"/> young Gentlemen, being Persons both studious and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to determine the Point in reference to Land and Sea-Animals, I could produce a thousand Examples of the Docility, and a thousand more of good Nature in Beasts, which the Famous City of <hi>Rome</hi> has given us an opportunity to fetch from her Imperial Theaters; but we will leave these things fresh and untouch'd, for them to embellish with their eloquent Discourse. In the mean time I have something to offer by the by, which is this, that I am of Opinion, that there is a mutilation, disease and defect peculiar to every part, and faculty, as Blindness of the Eye, Lameness of the Leg, and Stuttering of the Tongue, which defects cannot be appropriated to any other Members. For that Blindness can never be attributed to that, which was never created to see; nor Lameness to that, which never could go, nor can any thing be said to Stammer, that wants a Tongue, or to Lisp or Stutter, that has not a vocal Utterance. As nothing can be said to be a Changeling, or beside his wits, or mad, to which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has deny'd the Use of Thought, Reason and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; for it is imposible without some faculty or other to be affected; seeing 'tis only that same faculty that must suffer either privation or mutilation, or some other defect. But you have seen Dogs, that have been mad; and I have seen Horses under the same predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and some there are, who say that Bulls and Foxes will be mad. But the Example of Dogs is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, which is unquestionable. Which makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that those Creatures have a sort of Reason and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding not to be despis'd, which being once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd and troubl'd, is call'd madness. For we do not find either their sight or their hearing diminish'd; but only like a Man affected with Hypochondriac Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, or in a delirium; of whom it would be absur'd to say, that he was not beside himself, or that his Sense
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46328:55"/> Reason and Memory were not disturb'd. For custom tells, that they who are in a raving condition are not in their right Senses, but are fallen from their Reason; and so whoever believes that there is any other cause why Dogs run mad, but only that their Senses, Reason and Memories are disturb'd, while they cease to know Faces the most familiar to them before, abandon their most usual Food, and oversee what is just before their Eyes, such a Man, I say, seems to me to contend against Truth it self, and out of ignorance to set himself upon the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of evident Matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soclares.</hi> You seem to me to be very much in the Right. For the Stoicks and Peripateticks, are lead to affirm the contrary upon this supposition, that Justice could have no certain Original, but would be altogether incomprehensible and inexistent, if all Brute Creatures should partake of Reason. For either of necessity it must be a very great piece of Injustice in us to devour and feed upon them, or if we forbear the use of them, it would be impossible for us to live; or rather we should in some measure live the Lives of Beasts, rejecting the use of Brute Creatures. I pass by those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Myriads of <hi>Nomades</hi> and <hi>Troglodytes,</hi> that know no other Food but Flesh. But as for us, that seem to live lovingly and in friendship together, what neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity would there be of labouring the Earth, of toyling upon the Sea, or mining in the Mountains; what need the care of dressing Victuals, if it were so that we must be bound to live, as it would then become us, not only without injury, but rather with all civility and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty toward all the sorts of Beasts, as being our Fellow rational Creatures? We have no cure, no remedy for an unquestionable necessity that deprives us either of Life or Justice, unless we observe that Ancient Bound and Dispensation which according to <hi>Hesiod,</hi> distinguishing <hi>Natures,</hi> and seperating every Kind by themselves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<q>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:46328:55"/>
                     <l>The Fish, wild Beasts, and all the winged Fowl,</l>
                     <l>To prey upon their Kinds without controul;</l>
                     <l>For among them no Law, nor Justice reigns,</l>
                     <l>Only by Justice Man from Man abstains.</l>
                  </q> And therefore as Brutes can extend no Act of Justice to us, so can neither we commit any Act of Injustice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Which argument they who reject, have left us no benefit of Life, nor any the smallest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance for Justice into the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Autobulus.</hi> These things dear friend you utter, as the Opinion of those People; But we are not to allow Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers a Remedy to procure easie delivery, as they do to Women that are subject to hard Labours, meerly that they may bring us forth Justice without any pain or trouble. For the same Persons will not allow it to <hi>Epicurus</hi> in the greatest things; when our of laziness he would make us believe the Starrs and all the Creatures were made at first by chance, meerly by the slight tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of so small and pitiful a thing as an Atome; and thereby prevent the Labours of Reason within us. Seeing therefore they neither make out what is uncertain, nor grant what is apparent, 'tis but requisite they should submit in what has been said concerning Beasts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Justice, if they will not acknowledge their Error, or otherwise demonstrate. For Justice has ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to Establish it self, neither so steep nor slippery, nor leading to the subversion of evident Truths, but which, according to <hi>Plato's</hi> instruction, my Son, and thy Friend, <hi>Soclares,</hi> has shew'd to such as are not captiously contentious, but willing to learn. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that both <hi>Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> held it for a Truth, that Man could not be altogether cleared from Injustice toward the Beasts, often bewayling and excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming against Nature, as if she were nothing else but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46328:56"/>
                  <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> having neither any thing unmixt, nor any thing truly pure, but still arriving at her end by many and those unjust and unlawful Passions. Whence they affirm that she Originally proceeded from Injustice, by the conjunction of immortal with mortal; and for that the thing engender'd is still delighted with the Parts of that, which engenders, dismember'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Nature from the whole. But this seems to be too luxuri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nt and severe an Accusation of Nature: For there is yet a more moderate excuse, which does not altogether deprive the Beasts of Reason, yet justifies the necessary and convenient use of them; which when the Ancients introduc'd, they detested and utterly discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd voracious, and voluptuous gluttony. <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> also resum'd the Argument, how we might reap the benefit of the Creatures without doing injustice. For they do no Injustice, that chastize and kill such Savage Beasts, that are both hurtful to Man, and never will be tam'd: But taming such as are gentle and loving to Men, thereby to make them assistant in the several Uses to which they were ordain'd.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The Horse and Ass, that Backs to load resign,</l>

               <p>Which as <hi>Prometheus</hi> in <hi>Eschylus</hi> observes,

               </p>
               <p>Thus we make use of Dogs to guard our Goats and Sheep, while they are milk'd and shorn. For Life does not presently forsake a Man, unless he be fed with <hi>Periwinkles,</hi> or the Livers of Geese, or unless he may kill whole Oxen or Kids to supply his Banquets: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it out of any extravagancy upon the Theatre,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46328:56"/> or to pass away their time in Hunting, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel some Beasts to be daring, and to fight against their wills, and kill others, whom Nature has not arm'd to defend themselves. For in my opinion, he that is for sport and pastime, ought to seek out for such as will sport and be merry with him. And therefore it was the saying of <hi>Bion,</hi> that though Boys throw Stones at Frogs in sport, yet the Frogs do not dye in sport but in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest; so in Hunting and Fishing, the fault is in the Men delighting in the torments and cruel deaths of Beasts, and tearing them without compassion from their Whelps and their young Ones. For 'tis not in the making use of Beasts that Men do them wrong, but in the wastfully and cruelly destroying them.</p>

                  <hi>Soclares.</hi> Then <hi>Aristotimus,</hi> 'tis high time for you to speak, and for us to hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotimus.</hi> The Court is open to all concern'd in the Controversieâ€” Others there are that kill their young Ones, by leaping the Females at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46328:57"/> of their bringing forth. There are a sort of <hi>Mullets</hi> call'd <hi>Pardi,</hi> that feed upon their own slime. But the <hi>Pourcontrell</hi> or <hi>Polypus</hi> sits all the Winter feeding upon its self,
<q>In needy House and Domicills forlorn.</q> so slothful, so stupid, so given to his Gut he is, or else so abandon'd to all those Vices together. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Plato</hi> again and again forbids, or rather makes it his Wish in his Laws, that young Men might not be permitted to addict themselves to <hi>Marine Fishery:</hi> wherein there is no Exercise of Strength, no Cogitation of Wisdom; nor any thing that contributes to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, swiftness or agility, in combating against <hi>Pikes, Congers</hi> or <hi>Scates;</hi> whereas in the Chase of Wild Beasts, the feircer sort accustom the Huntsman to contempt of danger; the more subtil sort, exercise and sharpen his wit and cunning; the swifter sort, exercise his Strength, and render him more apt to endure labour. These are the Advantages that accrue to a Man by Hunting; but in Fishing, there is nothing worth his while. For never any of the Gods got honour by the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of a <hi>Conger-killer;</hi> as <hi>Apollo</hi> was Sir-nam'd the <hi>Wolf-slayer;</hi> never any of the <hi>Deities</hi> glory'd in being a <hi>Darter of Mullets,</hi> as <hi>Diana</hi> is honor'd with the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Hart-darting;</hi> and what wonder is it? when it is accompted more Noble for a Man to kill then to buy a Wild Boar, a Hart, a Goat or a Hare, but more honorable to buy a <hi>Thunny,</hi> a <hi>Lobster,</hi> or an <hi>Amy,</hi> then to kill 'em. And therefore because there is nothing in Fishing that is noble, no using of Ginns and slight of cunning, it is accompted a sorry pitiful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, not worth a Man's labour. In general then, since the usual Arguments by which Philosophers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate that Beasts partake of Reason are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46328:58"/> Purpose, Contrivance, Memory, Passions, Care of their young Ones, Gratefulness to those from whom they receive Kindnesses, and the Remembrance of shrew'd Turns: To which we may add the search af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and choice of what is needful and beneficial for them, together with apparent shews of Vertue, as of Fortitude, Society, Continence and Magnanimity, if we consider the Marine Creatures, we shall not find, that our strictest Observation can perceive in them any of these Excellencies, or at best such obscure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect glimmerings, as are scarce discernible. But in Terrestrial and Land-Animals, there is not any Man but may behold the most luculent, the most evident and uncontroulable demonstrations in the World of all that has been said. In the first place observe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Preparations of Bulls provok'd to Combat, and of Wild Boars whetting their Teeth. Again, Elephants, when they have digg'd up, or tore down the Trees, which they intend to feed upon, and thereby blunted and worn out one of their Tushes, they only make use of that for those purposes, but reserve the other strong and sharp for their own Defence. The Lyon also always walks with his Feet inverted, hiding his Claws within side his Paw, to prevent the Hunter from tracing him easily by his Footing. For the Track of a Lyons Claw is not easily to be found, so that the Hunters are frequently at a loss, and wander after the obscure and scarce discernible Footsteps of those Beasts. You have heard also, I suppose, of the <hi>Ichneumon,</hi> how that he Arms himself as compleatly as a Souldier with his Breast-plate and Cuirace prepar'd for Battle, in such a manner does that Creature sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round and wrap himself about with a Coat of Mud when he attacks the Crocodile.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:46328:58"/>
               <p>Admirable are the Preparations of Swallows before they go to lay their Eggs, how they place the more solid Stubble for foundations, and upon that build up the slighter straws; and if they perceive that the Nest wants Mud instead of Glue, you may observe how they fly to the next Lake or Sea, and after they have skimm'd the Superficies of the Water with their Wings, they lick up the Dust, and so daub and bind together the loose and ill cohering Parts of the Nest. As for the Form of their Architecture, it is neither compos'd of Angles nor many sides, but smooth, and as much as may be, Spherical; for that such a Figure is lasting and capacious; and not easily affording entrance to Creatures that lye in wait for their destruction from without.</p>
               <p>Who is there that does not admire for more reasons then one the Labour of the Spiders, so like the Threads that Women spin, and the Nets that are us'd in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For the extraordinary fineness of the Spinning, and evenness of the Thread, not discontinu'd or snapp'd off like the Yarn upon a Quill, but having the smooth and subtil texture of a thin Membrane, and knit and spun together, with a certain clammy moisture imperceptibly mixt; besides the Tincture of it, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a kind of Airy and Misty colour, the better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; but above all the Conduct and Governing of this little Engin, in which when any thing happens to be entangl'd, you see how presently like an expert Huntsman, the subtil Artist contracts her Net, and binds her prey within it. All which were it not every day ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to our sight and Contemplation, gives Credit to to my Discourse, which otherwise might be accounted no less fabulous, then what is reported of certain <hi>Lybian</hi> Cranes, that when they are a thirsty, throw Stones into the Water, by that means to raise it to such a height, that they may be able to reach it with their Bills. Then again when I saw a Ship Dog in the absence of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46328:59"/> the Seamen, putting in Stones into a half empty Jar of Oyl, it was to me a wonder how that Dog should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the Compression of the heavier weight would make the lighter rise. And the same Artifices are reported of <hi>Cretan</hi> Bees and <hi>Cilician</hi> Geese.</p>
               <p>For the first of these, being to take their flight about some windy Promontory, ballast themselves with little Stones, to prevent their being carry'd away by the stronger blasts. And as for the Geese, they being afraid of the Eagles, every time they cross the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Taurus,</hi> carry great Stones in their Mouths to the end, that by that means, as it were, bridling their gagling Tongues, they may cross the Mountain in silence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alaruming their Enemies.</p>
               <p>Extraordinary also is the Caution which the <hi>Cranes</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in their flight. For they flie when the Wind is very high, and the Air very tempestuous, not as in fair weather with their Beaks in their Breasts like a Half-Moon, but forming a Triangular Body, with the sharp Angle of that Figure they penetrate the Wind that ruffles round about 'em, and by that means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their Order unbroken. On the other side when they fall upon the Ground, those that are upon the Night Watch stand with the whole weight of their Bodies upon one Leg, holding a Stone in the Claw of the other Foot. For the holding of the Stone keeps them awake for a long time together; and wakes them again with the noise of the fall, if they happen to drop asleep. So that it was no wonder, that <hi>Hercules</hi> laid his Quiver under his Arm-pit, and with his strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arm embracing his Bow;
<q>
                     <l>Slept all the Ntght, where e're he laid his Load,</l>
                     <l>With his right-handed weight upon the Wood.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:46328:59"/> Nor do I so much admire at him, who was the first that hit upon the way to open an Oyster, when I meet with and consider the Artifices of the <hi>Herons.</hi> For a <hi>Heron,</hi> when he has swallow'd a gaping Oyster, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures the trouble and vexation of it for so long time, till he perceives it soften and relax'd by the heat of his Stomac; then casting it up again gaping and divided, he takes out that which is fit for Food.</p>
               <p>But accurately to relate the Oeconomie and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the Emmets, as it is a task of great Labour, so it would argue too much of Negligence to pass them over in silence. For there is not in nature a smaller Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet a most absolute Mirror of the greatest and most noble performances, and, as it were, in a transparent drop, the Appearance of all vertue. There is Friendship to be discern'd in Mutual Society. There is the Image of Fortitude in the patient undergoing of Labour. In them are to be seen many Seeds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, many of Wisdom and Justice. Insomuch that <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> who deny'd that Beasts were endu'd with Reason, could not forbear reporting how he met with the following Accident of a Crowd of Emmets, that came to another. Ant-hill, bringing along with them a dead Emmet. Presently other Emmets ascending out of their Ant-hill, seem'd, as it were, to meet them, and then disappear'd again, and this was done twice or thrice. Till at length, the one side brought up from under ground a worm, as the Price of the dead Emmets Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, which the other Party of Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mires receiving deliver'd the dead Emmet and so departed. But that which is apparent to all, is their Equity to each other when they meet one another, while they that carry nothing, always give way to those that are burdened, nor are their Corrosions and Partitions of things, too weighty for single carriage, less remarkable, to the end the Burdens may be divided among many. But

For fear therefore that preserving the quality, it should become useless for food, they eat out the very principal part of the Grain, from whence the Wheat sends forth its blossom. I must confess, I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of those, who dig up Ant-hills on purpose to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Learning, as it were by Anatomy.

               <p>I am afraid you may deem me too Impertinent in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Elephants</hi> with <hi>Pismires,</hi> and yet I cannot but think it seasonable, to shew the Nature and Force of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well in the smallest as in the greatest Bodies, neither obscur'd in the one, nor deficient in the other.</p>
               <p>Some there are that admire in an <hi>Elephant</hi> his apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to learn, and to be taught, and the many various Postures and Alterations of movement which he shews upon the Theaters, not easily to be equall'd by human Assiduity, as suttle and abounding in Memory and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention as he is. But for my part, I rather chose to prove his evident Understanding from the Passions and Inclinations of the Creature, that were never taught him, but only infus'd by Nature, as being altogether unmix'd and pure without the help of Art.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> not very long ago, there were many <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants</hi> that were taught many dangerous Postures, many windings and turnings and circular screwings of their bulky Bodys hard to be exprest, among which there was one, which being duller then the rest, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often rated and chastiz'd for his stupidity, was seen in the Night-time, by Moon-light without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forc'd to it, to Practice over his Lessons with all the Industry imaginable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agno</hi> tells a Story of an Elephant in <hi>Syria</hi> that was bred up in a certain House, who observ'd that his Keeper took away and defrauded him every day of half the Measure of his Barley, only that once the Master being present and looking on, the Keeper powr'd out the whole Measure. Which was no sooner done, but the Elephant extending his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boscis,</hi> separated the Barley and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>vided it into two equal parts, thereby ingeniously discovering, as much as in him lay, the injustice of his Keeper.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:46328:61"/>
               <p>Another in revenge that his Keeper mix'd Stones and Durt with his Barley, as the Keepers Meat was boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the Fire, took up the Ashes and flung them into the Pot.</p>
               <p>Another being vext and provok'd by the Boys in <hi>Rome,</hi> that prickt his <hi>Proboscis</hi> with the sharp ends of their Writing-steels, caught one of them in his <hi>Probos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> and mounted him up in the Air, as if he intended to have squash'd out his Guts; but upon the loud out-crys of the Spectators, set him gently down again upon his Feet, and so went on, believing he had sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punish'd the Boy in skaring him. Many other things are reported of the Wild Elephants that feed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul, as being under their own Jurisdiction, but nothing more to be admir'd then their passing of great Rivers. For first of all the youngest and the least flounces into the Stream; whom the rest beholding from the shoar, if they see that the less bulky Leader keeps steady footing with his Back above Water, they are then assur'd and confident that they may boldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture without any danger.</p>
               <p>Having thus far proceeded in our discourse, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it well done to pass by the cunning of the Fox, by reason of the similitude it has with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. The Muthologists tell us, that the Dove which <hi>Deucalcon</hi> sent out of his <hi>Ark,</hi> returning back again, was to him a certain sign of the Storm not ceas'd; but of serene and fair weather when she flew quite away. But the <hi>Thracians,</hi> to this day, when they design to pass a River that is frozen over, make use of a Fox to try whether the Ice will bear or no. For the Fox treading gently, lays his Ear to the Ice, and if he perceive by the noise of the Water that the Stream runs very close underneath, conjecturing from thence that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation is not deep, but thin and no way stedfastly solid, he makes a stop, and if he be suffer'd, returns back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46328:61"/> but if he perceive no noise, he goes on boldly. Nor can we say that this is only an exquisiteness of Sense without Reason, but a Syllogistical deduction from Sense; concluding that whatever makes a noise is mov'd; whatever is mov'd, cannot be frozen; what is not frozen is moist, what is moist gives way. The <hi>Logicians</hi> say, that a Dog making use of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from many disjunctive Propositions, thus reasons with himself in places where several High ways meet; either the Wild Beasts is gone this way, or that, or that way; but not that way not that way, therefore this way: The force of Sense affording nothing but the Presumption; but the force of Reason affording the major Proposition, and inferring the Conclusion of the Assumption. But a Dog stands in no need of any such Testimonial; in regard it is both false and adulterate. For Sense it self shews which way, the Beast is fled by his Trachs and Foot-steps, bidding farwel to disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and copulate Axioms; and the Nature of Dogs is palpably to be discern'd by many other Actions, Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and dutiful Services, neither the effects of hearing or seeing, but only practicable by Reason and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. It would be ridiculous for me to discourse the Continence, Obedience and Industry of Dogs in Hunting, to you, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> are so well confirm'd in the knowledge of those things by daily Experience and Practice.</p>
               <p>There was a certain <hi>Roman</hi> slain in the Civil Wars, whose Head no body durst cut off, before they kill'd the Dog that guarded his body and fought in defence of his Master. It happen'd that King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> Travailing that way, lit upon the Dog watching over the Carkass of the Person slain, and hearing that the Dog had been there three days without meat or drink, yet would not forsake his dead Master, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>d red the Man to be buryed, but that the Dog should be preserv'd and brought to him.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46328:62"/> A few days after there was a Muster of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, so that they were forc'd to march all in Order by the King with the Dog quietly lying by him for a good while. But when he saw the Murtherers of his Master pass by him, he flew upon 'em with a more then ordinary fury, barking and baying and tearing his Throat, and ever and anon turning about to the King; which did not only increase the Kings suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the jealousie of all that stood about him. Upon which the Men were presently apprehended, and though the Circumstances were very slight which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise appear'd against them, yet they confess'd the Fact, and were Executed.</p>
               <p>The same thing is reported to have been done by a Dog that belong'd to <hi>Hesiod,</hi> Sir-nam'd the <hi>Wise,</hi> which discover'd the Sons of <hi>Ganychtor</hi> the <hi>Naucletian,</hi> by whom <hi>Hesiod</hi> was Murther'd. But that which came to the knowledge of our Parents, when they were Students at <hi>Athens</hi> is yet more evident then any thing we have said. For a certain Person getting into the Temple of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> after he had stollen all the Massy Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gold and Silver, made his escape not believing he was discover'd. But the Dog that belong'd to the Temple who was call'd <hi>Cipparus,</hi> when he found that none of the <hi>Sacristanes</hi> took any notice of his barking, pursu'd himself the Sacrilegious Theif; and though at first the Fellow paulted him with stones, he could not beat him off. So soon as it was day, the Dog still fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him thÃ´ at such a distance, that he always kept him in his Eyes: When the Fellow threw him Meat he refus'd it; when the Theif went to Bed, the Dog watch'd at his door, and when he rose in the Morning, the Dog still follow'd him, fawning upon the Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon the Road, but still barking and baying at the Heels of the Theif. These things when they who were in pursuit of the Sacrilegious Person heard, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46328:62"/> were told withal by those they met the colour and bigness of the Dog, they were the more vigorous in the pursuit, and by that means overtaking the Theif, brought him back from <hi>Cromyon,</hi> while the Dog ran before leaping and capering, and full of joy, as it were challenging to himself the praise and reward of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Temple-robber. And indeed the <hi>Athenians</hi> were so grateful to him that they decreed him such a quantity of Meat to be publickly measur'd to him, and order'd the Priests to take care to see it done; in imitation of the Kindness of the Ancient <hi>Athenians</hi> to reward the Mule.</p>
               <p>For when <hi>Pericles</hi> built the Temple <hi>Hecatonpedon</hi> in the <hi>Acropolis</hi> or Tower of <hi>Athens,</hi> it so fell out, that the stones were to be fetch'd every day many furlongs off, and a world of Carriages were made use of for that purpose. Among the rest of the Mules that labour'd hard in this employment, there was one that though dismiss'd by reason of Age, wou'd still go down to the <hi>Keramicon</hi> and meeting the Carts that brought the Stones, would be always in their Company running by their sides, as it were by way of Encouragment and to excite them to work chearfully. So that the People admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Zeal of the Mule, order'd him to be fed at the public charge, as they were wont to decree public Almes to the superannuated Wrestlers.</p>
               <p>And therefore they who deny that there is nothing of Justice due from us towards dumb Animals, may be said to speak true, so far as concerns them that Live in the Sea and haunt the Abysses of the Deep. For those Kind of Creatures are altogether unsociable, without affection for their Young Ones, void of all softness of disposition; and therefore it was well said of <hi>Homer</hi> speaking to a Person whom he look'd upon as a meer Savage,

But he that uses the same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and Arguments against Land-Animals, is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Brute and Savage Creature. Unless any Man will affirm that there was nothing of Justice due from <hi>Lysimachus</hi> to the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Dog, that would not stir from the Body of his Deceased Master, and when he saw his Masters Carkass burning, ran and threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Flames.

For upon the death of his Master, he would not stir from the Body, but when it was carry'd forth leap'd upon the Beer, and at length threw himself into the Funeral Pile and was burnt alive with his Masters Body.</p>
               <p>The Elephant also which carry'd King <hi>Porus</hi> when the King was wounded in the Battle against <hi>Alexander,</hi> pull'd out several Darts out of his Wounds with his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boscis,</hi> with no less tenderness and care then the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugeon could have done; and though the Elephant himself were but in a very bad condition, yet would he not lye down, till he perceiv'd the King all over of a goar Blood ready to sink; and then fearing least the King should fall, he stoop'd down gently, to ease the King in sliding to the Ground.</p>
               <p>Such was the Humor of <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> who before he was accouter'd, would suffer his Groom to back him, but when he had all his Royal Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and <hi>Houses</hi> about him, would permit no Body but <hi>Alexander</hi> to bestride him. But if any other Persons approach'd him in curiosity to try what they could do, he encounter'd 'em open-mouth'd,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46328:63"/> and neighing out his fury, leap'd upon their Shoulders, bore 'em down, and trampl'd 'em under his Feet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less prevented by keeping at a distance or by speedy flight.</p>
               <p>Nor am I ignorant but that there is something of Variety in every one of these Examples, which you must acknowledge. And indeed it is not easie to find out the natural Dexterity of any one ingenious and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Animal, which is not accompany'd with more then one single vertue. Thus where there is affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their Young ones, there is desire of Praise: where there is generosity, there is also moderation of Anger. Cunning likewise and Understanding are rarely parted from daring boldness and fortitude. But as for those that rather chuse to divide and distinguish every one of these vertues particularly themselves, they shall find in Dogs a fair demonstration of a gentle and yet lofty Mind at the same time, in turning away from such as sit quietly upon the ground: according to that of <hi>Homer,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>With hideous noise the Dogs upon him slew,</l>
                     <l>But sly <hi>Ulysses</hi> who the danger knew,</l>
                     <l>Sate husht and still, and from his Royal hand</l>
                     <l>His Scepter dropt, as useless in command.</l>
                  </q> For Dogs never bite nor worry those that prostrate themselves at their Mercy, and put on a face of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. Thus they say the bravest of those <hi>Indian</hi> Dogs that fought against <hi>Alexander,</hi> never stirr'd or so much as lookt about them upon the letting loose of a Hart, a Boar, and a Bear, but when they saw a Lyon, then they began to rouse, to shake and prepare thmselves for the Combat. By which it was plain that they only thought the Lyon an Antagonist worthy of their courage, but despis'd all the rest as below their anger.</p>

               <p>There are many Examples of cunning and suttlety abounding in Land Creatures; but to omit the Slights and Artifices of Foxes, Cranes and Jack-daws, of which I shall say nothing, because they are things already so well known, I shall make use of the Testimony of <hi>Thales,</hi> the most ancientest of our Philosophers, who is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have chiefly admir'd the most excellent in any Art or Cunning.</p>
               <p>A certain Mule that was wont to carry Salt, in ford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a River, by accident happen'd to stumble, by which means the Water melting away the Salt, when the Mule rose again, he felt himself much lighter; the Cause of which the Mule was very sensible of, and laid it up in his Memory; insomuch that every time he forded the same River, he would always stoop when he came into the deepest part, and fill his Vessels with Water, crouching down and leaning sometimes to one side, sometimes to another: <hi>Thales</hi> hearing this, order'd the Vessels to be well fill'd with Wooll and Spunges, and to drive the Mule laden after that manner. But then the Mule, as he was wont, filling his burthens with Water, reason'd with himself, that he had ill consulted his own benefit, and ever afterwards, when he forded the same River, was so careful and cautious, that by his good will he would never suffer his Burthens so much as to touch the Water.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:46328:64"/>
               <p>Another Peice of Cunning joyn'd with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Affection to their Young ones is to be observ'd in Patridges, which instruct their Young ones, 'ere they are able to flye, when they are pursu'd by the Fowlers, to lay themselves upon their Backs, their Breasts cover'd with some clod of Earth, or little heap of Dirt, conglomerated as it were like a Ball. On the other side, the Old Patridges to deceive the Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and draw them quite a contrary way, make short slights from one place to another, thereby inticing the Fowlers to follow them, till thus allur'd from their Young ones, the Fowlers give over all hopes of being Masters of their Game.</p>
               <p>In like manner <hi>Hares</hi> returning to their <hi>Forms,</hi> dispose their Leverets one in one place, another in another, at the distance many times of an Acre of ground: so that upon the tracing either of Men or Hounds, they are sure not to be all in danger at one time: themselves in the mean time not easie to be prick'd, by reason of the various windings and turnings which they make, and at length by giving a large leap discontinue the print of their Feet, and so betake themselves to their rest.</p>
               <p>A Bear when she perceives her self overgrown with Fat, before she grows stiff and unweildy, cleanses the place where she intends to conceal her self, and in her passage thither, lifts up her Paws as high as she can, and treads upon the Ground with the top of her Toes, and at length turning her self upon her back throws her self into her Receptacle.</p>
               <p>Your Hinds generally calve at a distance from all places frequented by Flesh-devouring Beasts: and Stags when they find themselves unwieldy through surplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Flesh and Fat, get out of the way and hide themselves, hoping to secure themselves by lurking, when they dare not trust to their Heels.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:46328:65"/>
               <p>The means by which the Land Hedge-hogs defend and guard themselves occasion'd the Proverb,
<q>
                     <l>Many slye Tricks the suttle Renard knows,</l>
                     <l>But one the Hedge-hog greater then all those.</l>
                  </q> For the Hedge-hog, as they report, when he spies the Fox coming,
<q>
                     <l>Round as a Pine Nut, or more Sphear-like Ball</l>
                     <l>Lies with his Body palisaded all</l>
                     <l>With pointed Thornes, which all the Foxes slight</l>
                     <l>Can find no way to touch, much less to bite.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Provision which the Hedge-hogs make for their Young Ones is much more ingenious. For when Autumn comes, they creep under the Vines, and shake off the Grapes with their Feet: which done they roul themselves up and down and take them up with their prickles, so that when they creep away again, you would think it a walking cluster (and this we have lookt on, and seen them do) after which returning to their Holes, they lay themselves down for their Young Ones to feed. Their Holes have two openings, one to the <hi>South,</hi> the other to the <hi>North.</hi> So that when they perceive the Alteration of the Air, like <hi>Pilots</hi> shifting their Sails, they stop up that which lyes to the Wind, and open the other. Which a certain Person that liv'd at <hi>Cyzycum</hi> observing, took upon him from thence at any time to tell in what corner the Wind would sit.</p>
               <p>As for Love and observance of Society joyn'd with Understanding and Prudence, <hi>Juba</hi> produces many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of it in Elephants. For it is the usual practise of the Elephant-Hunters to dig large Pits in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants Walks, and cover 'em slightly over with dry twigs or other materials; into which if any Elephant
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46328:65"/> happens to fall, the rest fetch Wood and Stones to fill up the cavity of the Pit, that the other may the more easily get out again. And some report of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, that they make Prayers to the Gods by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral instinct, that they perform divine Ceremonies to the Sea, and worship the rising Sun, lifting up their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boscis</hi>'s to Heaven instead of Hands. For which reason they are Creatures the most belov'd of any by the Gods, as <hi>Ptolomy Philopator</hi> testified. For having vanquish'd <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and being desirous to pay a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Honour to the Deity among many other Oblations of Thansgivings for his Victory, he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd four Elephants. After which being terrify'd with a Dream, which threatned him with the Wrath of the Deity for that prodigious Sacrifice, he sought out several ways to expiate his offence, and among the rest by way of propitiation, he erected four Elephants of Brass to attone for the four Elephants he had slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>Examples not inferior of the observance of Society are to be found among Lyons. For the younger car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forth the slow and aged when they hunt abroad for their Prey. When the old ones are weary and tyr'd, they rest and stay for the younger that hunt on; who when they have seiz'd upon any thing, call to the Old ones, making a noise like the bleating of a Calf: they presently hear, and so meeting all together, they feed in common upon the Prey.</p>
               <p>In the Amours of many Animals there is much varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; some are furious and Mad: others observe a kind of human Decency, and tricking of themselves to set off their Beauty, not without a Courtly kind of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such was the Amour of the Elephant at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> that rivall'd <hi>Aristophanes</hi> the Grammarian. For they were both in love with a Virgin that sold Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands; nor was the Elephants Courtship less conspicuous
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46328:66"/> then the others. For as he passed through the Fruit Market, he always brought her Apples, and stay'd with her for some time, and thrusting his <hi>Proboscis</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her Wastcoat, instead of his hand, took great delight in gently feeling her Breasts.</p>
               <p>No less remarkable was the Dragon in Love with the <hi>Etolian</hi> Woman. He came to her in the Night, and getting under her Garments to her very Skin, embrac'd her naked Body; and never either willingly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly did her any harm; but always about break of day departed: which the Kindred of the Woman observing to be the common custom of the Dragon, remov'd her a great way off. After that, the Dragon came not again for three or four days together, being all the while, as it seem'd, wandring about in search of her: But at length having with much ado found her out, he did not approach her with that mildness as he was wont to do, but after a rougher manner with the Folds of his Body having first bound her Hands and Armes, with the end of his Tayl he lash'd the Calves of her Legs; expressing thereby a gentle and loving anger, which had more in it of indulgent expostulation then punishment.</p>
               <p>I say nothing of a Goose in <hi>Egypt</hi> in Love with a a Boy; nor of the Ram in Love with <hi>Glauce</hi> that play'd on the Harp: For the Story is in all Peoples Mouthes, and besides I am apt to think you are satiated with Examples of this Nature.</p>
               <p>But as for Starlings, Magpies and Parrets, that learn to talk, and afford their Teachers such a Spirit of Voice so well temper'd and so adapted for imitation, they seem to me to patronize and defend the rest of the Creatures by their Talent of learning what they are taught, and in some measure to teach us, that those Creatures also, as well as they, partake of vocal expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Articulate Sound. From whence I conclude
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46328:66"/> it a most ridiculous thing in them, that would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare these Creatures with a sort of Mute Animals, I mean the Fish, that have not voice enough to howle or make a mournful noise. Whereas in the natural and untaught Notes of these Creatures what Music, what a charming Grace do we observe? To which the famous Poets, and choicest Singers among Men bear Testimony; while they compare their sweetest Odes and Poems to the Singing of Swans and Melody of Nightingales. Now in regard there is more of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Teaching then in Learning, we are to believe <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who assures us that Terrestrial Animals do that likewise; in regard that Nightingales have been observ'd instructing their young Ones to Sing. Of which this may be a sufficient Proof, that such Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales are known to sing worse that are taken very young from the Nest, and depriv'd of the Education of the Old One. For they both learn and are taught from the Old one, not for hire, or to get Reputation, but meerly out of a delight in mixing their Notes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and because they have a greater love for that which is excellent, and curious in the Voice then what is profitable. Concerning which I have a Story to tell ye which I heard from several <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> who were eye Witnesses of the thing.</p>
               <p>A certain Barber in <hi>Rome</hi> who had a Shop right against the Temple which is call'd the <hi>Greek's</hi> Market, bred in his House a kind of a Prodigy of a Magpy, whose Tongue would be always going with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Variety imaginable, sometimes imitating human Speech, sometimes chattering her Wild Notes, and sometimes humouring the Sounds of Wind Instruments, neither was this by any constraint, but as she accustom'd her self, with a more then ordinary Ambition to leave nothing unspoken, nothing that her Imita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ion should not master.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:46328:67"/>
               <p>It happen'd a certain Person of the wealthier sort, and newly dead in the Neighbour-hood, was carry'd forth to be buried with a great Number of Trumpets before him. Now in regard it was the custom of the Bearers to rest themselves before the Barbers-shop, the Trumpeters being Excellent in their Art, and withal commanded so to do, made a long stop, Sounding all the while.</p>
               <p>After that day the Magpye was altogether mute, not so much as uttering her usual Notes by which she call'd for what she wanted, insomuch that they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore admir'd as they pass'd to and fro at the chattering and prating of the Bird, now much more wonder'd at her suddain silence; and many suspected her to have been Poyson'd by some that affected peculiar skill in teaching those Kind of Birds. But the Greatest Number were of Opinion that the noise of the Trumpets had stupify'd her hearing, and that by the loss of her hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the use of her Voice was likewise extinguish'd: But the cause of her unusal silence proceeded from nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these Effects, but from her retiring to privacy by her self to exercise the imitation of what she had heard, and to fit and prepare her Voice as the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to express what she had learnt. For soon after she came of a suddain to sight again, but had quitted all her former customary Imitations, but only Soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Musick of the Trumpets, observing all the Changes and Cadencies of the Harmony with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness of time as was not to be imagin'd: An Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument as I have said before of a more rational aptness in those Creatures to learn of themselves, then from the Instructions of a teacher. Nor do I think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to pass by in silence one wonderful Example of the Docility of a Dog, of which I my self was a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in <hi>Rome.</hi> This Dog belong'd to a certain <hi>Mimic</hi> who at that time had the management of a <hi>Farce,</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:46328:67"/> wherein there was great variety of Parts, which he undertook to instruct the Actors to perform, and several Imitations proper for the matters and passions therein represented. Among the rest there was one who was to drink a sleepy Potion, and after he had drank it, to fall into a deadly drowsiness, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the Actions of a dying Person. The Dog, who had study'd several of the other Gestures and Postures, more diligently observing this, took a peace of Bread that was sopt in the Potion, and after he had eat it, in a short time counterfeited a trembling, then a staggering, and afterward a drowsiness in his Head: Then stretching out himself, he lay as if he had been dead; and seem'd to proffer himself to be drag'd out of the Place and carry'd to Burial, as the Plot of the Play re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd. Afterwards understanding the time from what was said and acted, in the first place he began gently to stir, as it were waking out of a profound sleep, and lifting up his Head, he gaz'd about him: Afterwards to the amazment of the Beholders, he rose up and went to his Master to whom he belong'd with all the signs of gladness and fawning kindness, insomuch that all the Spectators, and even <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, for Old <hi>Vespasian</hi> was present in <hi>Marcellus's</hi> Theatre, were taken with the sight.</p>
               <p>But perhaps we may seem ridiculous, for signalizing Beasts in this manner, because they learn, though with little reason, since we find that <hi>Democritus</hi> affirms us to have been their Schollars in greatest matters. Of the Spider, for weaving and repairing what we tear or wear out. Of the Swallow, for building Houses; and of the mournful Swan and Nightingale for singing and imitation of their Notes. Moreover in others we observe a Threefold Practice of Physic both natural and inbred. For Tortoises ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46328:68"/> and Dogs purge themselves from abounding Choller with a certain sort of Grass: The Dragon quickens the dimness of his sight with Fennel, and the Bear coming forth of her Cave, after long emaciation, feeds upon Wild <hi>Dragons;</hi> for the acrimony of that Herb opens and separates her Guts when clung together. At other times, being overcloy'd with food, she repairs to the Emmet-Hills, and thrusting forth her Tongue all soft and unctuous by reason of the sweet kind of slime that all besmears it, till it be crowded with Emmers, at length swallows them down her Throat, and so recovers. And it is reported that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> observe and imitate the Bird call'd <hi>Ibis,</hi> in purging and cleansing her Bowels with the briny Sea-water. For which reason, the Priests, when they hallow themselves, make use of the Water of which the <hi>Ibis</hi> has drank: For that those Birds will not drink the Water, if it be Medicinal, or otherwise infected. Some Beasts there are that cure themselves by Abstinence, as Wolves and Lyons, who when they are gorg'd with Flesh, lye still and digest their Crudities by the warmth of one anothers Bodies. It is reported also of the Tiger, that if a Kid be thrown to her, she will not eat in two days; but grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost famish'd the third day, if she be not supply'd with another, she will tear down the Cage that holds her, if she have strength enough; yet all this while she will not meddle with the first Kid, as being her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and fellow House-keeper.</p>
               <p>More then this the Elephants are said to make use of Chyrugery; for that being brought to Persons wounded they will draw forth the Heads of Spears and Arrows out of their Bodies with little pain, and without dilacerating and mangling the Flesh.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cretan</hi> Goats, which by eating Dittany expel the Arrows shot into their Bodies, taught Women with Child to understand the vertue of that Herb so
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46328:68"/> prevalent to expel the Birth. For those Goats being wounded seek no other cure, but presently seek out and hunt for Dittany.</p>
               <p>But these things though wonderful, are not so much to be admir'd, as are those Beasts that understand the use of numbers, and will reckon to such a Proportion; like the Oxen about <hi>Susa.</hi> For there are Oxen in that place that Water the Kings Gardens with portable Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, of which the number is fix'd: For every Oxe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a hundred Buckets every day, and more you cannot force them to take or carry would you never so fain, insomuch that when constraint has been us'd for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments sake, nothing could make them stir after they had carry'd their full number: Such an accurate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt do they take and preserve the same in their memory, as <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But that my discourse may draw to a Conclusion, let us add something concerning the Divinity and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick nature, with which our Terrestrial Creatures are endu'd. Which when we consider, we shall find, that that same part of Soothsaying, which is founded upon the observation of Birds, is not the meanest or most ignoble, but very ancient and in great esteem.

                  </gap>bility to receive all impressions of Fancy,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46328:69"/> afford the Deity a Convenience to make use of those faculties as Instruments, to turn them into Motion, into Sounds, Chirpings, and Forms, sometimes immoveable, sometimes fix'd, sometimes volatile like the Winds, by means of some of these stopping short, by the means of others directing to their end the Actions and impetuous Impulses of Men: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Euripides</hi> in general, calls Birds the <hi>Cryers of the Gods;</hi> and particularly <hi>Socrates</hi> stiles himself a fellow Servant with the <hi>Swans.</hi> As among Princes, <hi>Pyrrus</hi> was pleas'd with the <hi>Sirname</hi> of <hi>Eagle;</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> lov'd to be call'd <hi>Anticchus</hi> the <hi>Falcon:</hi> But they who deride Men insipid and void of Ingenuity, call them by the Names of Fish. And whereas we can produce millions of Things and Accidents which are fore-told us by Land and flying Creatures, there is not any one such Example that the Patrons of Water-Animals can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in their behalf; but being all void of hearing, perfectly sottish, and without any sight or discerning of providence, they are all thrown apart into that same place unblest and hideous call'd the Sea, as it were into the Region of the Ungodly, where the rational and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual part of the Soul, is extinguish'd; only being animated with some diminutive portion, the lowest that may be imagin'd of a confus'd and overwhelm'd Sence, they rather seem to palpitate them breath.</p>

                  <hi>Phoedimus.</hi> Therefore you see, 'tis plain here has been foul Play and Treachery in the Case; for a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sober and upon premeditation, to set upon us when we were Stomach-sick and doaz'd with our last Nights
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46328:69"/> Compotation. But there is no way to avoid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: for that being an Imitator of <hi>Pindar</hi> it shall never be said of me,

                     <l>Combats refus'd, when nobly set upon,</l>

                  </q> For we have leisure enough, as having nor only allow'd our selves a vacation from Jollity and Balls, but our Hounds and Horses a relaxation from their Labours; and with all having hung up our drag Nets and Spears, as having also this day granted, for Disputations sake, a general Truce to all Creatures as well upon the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

However fear not; for I will use it moderately, without producing either the Opinions of Philosophers, or the Fables of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations either of the <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Libyans</hi> wanting Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: but such as shall be verify'd by good Witnesses, such as have made it their business to toil upon the Ocean, and gave Credit to their Eyes. For to say truth there is not any one of those Examples which are produc'd from the Land which do not confirm their Histories, as being manifested to Sense: Whereas the Sea affords but few but what are difficult to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. The Sea concealing the Generation and Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of most of her Creatures, their Antipathies, and ways of preserving themselves. In reference to which many Acts of their Understanding, Memory and Community being unknown to us, is the reason that we cannot be so copious in our Discourse. Then again, Land Animals, by reason of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triture, Education and Imitation: which sweetens and allays all their Acerbity and Morosness, like the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fresh-water with Sea-brine; and awakening
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46328:70"/> that which is slow and disorderly in them, inflames it with human Motions. Whereas the living of Sea-Animals being by many degrees remote from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse of Men, and having nothing adventitious, or that may be said to be acquir'd by Custom, and Familiarity, is altogether peculiar, genuine and unmix'd with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners strange and foreign to them; which proceeds ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Nature, or the Place it self. For Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and cherishing whatever Knowledge comes to her self, affords it also to Fish, and makes many <hi>Eeles</hi> tame and familiar to Men; which for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son are call'd Sacred, like those in the River <hi>Arethuse;</hi> so that in many places there are Fish that will hear and obey when call'd by their Names: as the story goes of <hi>Crassus</hi>'s Mullet, upon the Death of which he wept. For which when <hi>Domitius</hi> twitted him in these words, <hi>Did not you weep when your Mullet dy'd?</hi> he retorted upon him again, <hi>Did you bury three Wives and never wept at all?</hi> The Crocodiles belonging to the Priests not only know the Voices of those that call them, and suffer themselves to be strok'd and handl'd, but gaping hold out their Teeth to be cleans'd and wip'd by the hands of the Priests.</p>
               <p>Lately <hi>Philinus,</hi> after he had been long travelling in <hi>Egypt,</hi> returning to us, told us how he saw in the City, which derives its Name from <hi>Anteus,</hi> an Old Woman sleeping by the side of a <hi>Crodocile</hi> upon a low soft Bed well and decently dress'd up.</p>
               <p>In Ancient Histories we find that when King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> call'd the Sacred Crocodile; and that the Crocodile nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vouchsafed to appear at his call, nor would answer to the earnest Expostulations of the Priests, it was lookt upon as a Prognostication of the Death of the King, which happen'd soon after. Which shews that the Race of Water-Animals is neither without a share of that inestimable thing call'd Prophetic Signification,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46328:70"/> nor undeserving those Honours ascrib'd to Land Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For that about <hi>Sura,</hi> which is a Village in <hi>Lycia</hi> between <hi>Phellus</hi> and <hi>Myro,</hi> I have heard it credibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that there are certain Persons who make it their business to watch the flights and pursuits of the Fish, and from thence by a certain Art which they have they gather predictions, as others from the Observation of Birds. But let these Examples suffice to shew that Fish are not altogether Strangers to Mankind, nor altogether void of human Affection.</p>
               <p>But for a great and common demonstration of their unmixt and natural Understanding, we find that there is not any Fish that swims, unless they be such as stick and cling to the Rocks, which are so easily taken by Men, as Asses are seiz'd by Wolves; Bees by Black-birds, Grashoppers by Swallows, Serpents by Harts; which are therefore call'd <hi>Elaphoi,</hi> not from their swiftness, but from a faculty which they have of drawing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents to them by the force of their Breath. Or as Sheep call the Wolf by the sound of their Feet, or as the Panther allures to her Paws both Apes and other Creatures by the fragrant smell of her Body. But so suspicious is the Sense of all Water-Animals, and so watchful are they to avoid all Baits and Treacheries against them by reason of their extraordinary cunning, that Fishing thereby becomes no easie, or single Labour, but a Toyl that requires various Instruments and many Tricks of human Cunning and Deceit: and this is apparent from Examples near at hand. For no Man desires an <hi>Angling-Rod</hi> too thick, tho strong enough to hold against the twitches of the Fish when taken; but rather they require it slender, least by casting too great a shadow upon the Water, they should frighten the suspicious Creature. In the next place they never knit too many knots in the Line, but make it as smooth as may be; for that would too much discover the Deceit;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46328:71"/> and then for the Hairs which are next the Hook, they endeavour to get the whitest they can meet with. For so by reason of the likeness of Colour, they lye the more easily conceal'd in the Water. Therefore some there are, who expounding the following Verses of <hi>Homer,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>This to the bottom quickly sinks like Lead,</l>
                     <l>And drawing down the Curles of the Bulls Head,</l>
                     <l>While thus the secret Baits concealed lye,</l>
                     <l>Makes deadly havock 'mong the Ravenous Frye.</l>
                  </q> believe that the Ancients made use of Bulls Hair for their Lines with which they angl'd; alledging that <hi>Keras</hi> then signify'd Hair, from whence <hi>Keirasthai</hi> to be shav'd, and <hi>Kura,</hi> shaving; and that <hi>Keroplastes</hi> in <hi>Archilochus,</hi> signify'd a <hi>Barber.</hi> But this is an Error. For they made use of Horse-Hair, more especially that of Stone-horses. For Mares by moistning their Tayles with their Urine, render the Hair weak and brittle. Tho <hi>Aristotle</hi> will not allow any thing to be said in all this that shew'd any such extraordinary suttlety in Men. Only he says, that the lower peice of the Line was fortify'd with a little hollow piece of Horn, which the Fish swallow'd before they could come at any thing else. Moreover that they made use of round Hooks to catch <hi>Mullets</hi> and <hi>Tunies,</hi> in regard they had but small Mouths, for that they were afraid of a strait Hook. He also farther says, that the Mullet many times suspecting the round Hook, will swim round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, flapping the Bait with his Tail, and then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round, secures to himself so much as he has bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off. Or if he cannot do that, he shuts his Mouth close, and with the extremities of his Lips nibbles off some part of the Bait.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:46328:71"/>
               <p>The Fish call'd <hi>Labrax</hi> behaves himself more stoutly then the Elephant; for when he perceives himself struck with the Hook, without assistance he sets himself at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, widening the Wound by flinging his Head to, and fro, and enduring the painful Twingings of the Hook, till he have freed himself from it with the loss of his Flesh.</p>
               <p>The Sea-Fox, or the Fish call'd <hi>Alopex</hi> seldom bites but avoids the Deceit; or if he chance to be taken, presently turns the Inside of his Body outward. For by reason of the strength and moisture of his Body, he has a peculiar faculty to turn it so, that the inside coming to be outermost, the hook falls off. These things demonstrate understanding, and a subtle and extraordinary use of it in the nick and juncture of time.</p>
               <p>Other examples there are, which shew not only this same understanding and knowledge but the community and mutual Affection of Fish. Thus if one <hi>Scate</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to swallow the Hook, all the rest of the Scates that are in the same shoal, presently croud together, and bite the Line in pieces. The same <hi>Scates</hi> if any of their Companions fall into the Net, give the Prisoners their Tayles to take hold of with their Teeth, and so draw them forth by main force.</p>
               <p>But the Fish call'd <hi>Anthiae</hi> with far more courage assist their fellows in distress. For getting under the Meshes with their Backs, and setting up their Finns, they never leave till they have saw'd them in two.</p>
               <p>Now we know no Land Animal that will assist and defend his Kind in danger; neither the Bear, nor the Wild Boar, nor the <hi>Leaena,</hi> nor the Panther; true it is that when they are in Heards together, they will gather into a Circle, and defend each other in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: but no single Land Animal either knows or
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46328:72"/> cares to assist a single Companion, but flyes and shifts for himself as far off as he can, from the Beast that is wounded and lyes a dying. For as for that same story of Elephants filling up the Ditches with heaps of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Materials whether Wood or Earth, for the unfortunate Elephant the more easily to get up again, it is so extreamly uncouth and foreign to us, as if we were bound to believe <hi>Juba</hi>'s Books by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Royal Edict. However if it were true, it does but serve to shew that many of the Marine Creatures are nothing inferior in Understanding and Community then the most intelligent of the Land Animals. But as for their mutual Society we shall discourse apart of that by it self.</p>
               <p>Now the Fishermen observing how that most Fish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the casts of their Hooks, by cunning or by striving with the Tackling, betook themselves to force, like the <hi>Persian</hi> Hunters, making use of Nets, that there might be no escape for those that were caught either by the help of reason or suttlety. Thus Mullets and the Fish call'd <hi>Julides</hi> are taken with Sweep-Nets and Drag-Nets, as are also several other sorts of Fish call'd <hi>Mormuri, Sargi, Gobii,</hi> and <hi>Labraces;</hi> those that are call'd Casting-Nets catch the Mullet, the Gilthead, and the Scorpion-Fish: and therefore <hi>Homer</hi> calls this sort of Fishing with Nets <hi>Panagra,</hi> or the <hi>All sweeper.</hi> And yet there are some Fish that are too cunning for these Nets.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Labrax</hi> or <hi>Jack</hi> perceiving the drawing of the Sweep Net with the force of his Body beats a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low place in the mud where he lays himself close till the Net be gone over him.</p>
               <p>But as for the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> when he finds himself taken and in the midst of the Net, he remains there without being in the least perplext, but falls too with a great deal of Joy, and feasts upon the numerous Fry within the Meshes: but so soon as he comes near the shoar,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46328:72"/> he bites his way through the Net with his Teeth and swims away. Or if he chance to be taken, the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do him no other harm the first time, but only sow a sort of large Bulrushes to the Finny Crown upon his Head and so let him go. If they take him a second time they punish him with stripes, well knowing him again by the Prints of the Needle. But that rarely happens. For having got his Pardon the first time, for the most part of them, they acknowledge the favour, and abstain from spoil for the future.</p>
               <p>Moreover, among the many Examples that make evident the wariness of Fish in avoiding the Deceits and Craft of the Fisher-men, it would not be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to pass by that of the <hi>Cuttle Fish.</hi> For this Fish carrying in that part of his Head which is near his Neck call'd his Nose, a certain black and inky sort of Liquor, so soon as he perceives himself discover'd, throws that Liquor forth, and darkens all the Water round about him in such a manner that the Fisher-men losing sight of him, by that means, he makes his escape: imitating therein <hi>Homers</hi> Deities, who when they had a mind to save any of their Heroes hid them in an Azure Cloud: but of this enough.</p>
               <p>Now for the extraordinary suttlery of Fish in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and catching their own Prey, we shall meet with several Examples of it in several Fish. Particularly the <hi>Star fish</hi> understanding his own nature to be such, that whatever he touches dissolves and liquifies, readily offers his Body, and permits himself to be touch'd by all that come near him.</p>
               <p>You know your self the property of the <hi>Torpedo</hi> or <hi>Crampfish,</hi> which not only benums all those that touch it, but also strikes a numness through the very Net into the hands of them that go about to take him. And some that have had greater experience of this Fish, report, that if it happen to fall alive upon the Land, they that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46328:73"/> pour Water upon it, shall presently perceive a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness seizing upon their hands and stupifying their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the Water affected with the Quality of the Fish. And therefore having an innate Sence of this faculty, it never makes any ressistance against any thing, nor ever is in danger. Only swimming circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly about his Prey, shoots forth the Effluviums of his Nature like so many Darts, and first infects the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then the Fish through the Water, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to defend it self nor to escape, being as it were held in Chains and frozen up.</p>
               <p>The Fisher-man is well known to many, who has his Name given him from his manner of catching Fish; whose Art, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> writes, the Cuttle Fish makes use of, for he lets down like a Line, a certain curle which nature has given him, so order'd as to let it run out at length, or draw it to him again, as he sees occasion. This when he sees any of the lesser Fish approach, he offers them to bite, and then by degrees pulls the curle nearer and nearer by vertue of the Bait, till he has drawn his Prey within the reach of his Mouth. And as for the <hi>Polypus</hi>'s changing his colour, <hi>Pindarus</hi> has made it famous in these words,
<q>
                     <l>In any City may that Man expose</l>
                     <l>His safety, who well knows</l>
                     <l>Like Sea-bred <hi>Polypus</hi> to range,</l>
                     <l>And vary colour upon every Change.</l>
                  </q> In like manner <hi>Theognis,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Change manners with thy Friends, observing thus</l>
                     <l>The vary colour'd cunning <hi>Polypus;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Who let him stick to whatsoever rock,</l>
                     <l>Of the same colour does his Body look</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:46328:73"/>
'Tis true the <hi>Chamaleon</hi> changes colour, not out of any design, or to conceal himself, but out of fear, being naturally timorous and trembling at every noise he hears: And this is occasion'd by the extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of breath which he enjoys, as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> affirms. For the whole Body of this Creature wants but little of being nothing else but Lungs; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates him to be full of Spirits, and consequently apt to change. But this same change of the <hi>Polypus</hi> is no product of any affection of the Mind, but a kind of Action. For he changes on purpose, making use of this Artifice to escape what he fears, and to get the Food which he lives by. For by fraud he takes those things that never avoid him, and avoids those things that pass him by without taking any notice of him. For that he devours his own Curles is an untruth; but that he is afraid of the <hi>Lamprey</hi> and <hi>Conger</hi> is certain: for by these he is ill treated, not being able to return them any Injury, by reason of their being so slippery: tho on the other side the Lobster having once got them within his Claws holds them with ease: For slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness affords no help against roughness: but when the <hi>Polypus</hi> comes to thrust his Horns into the Body of the Lobster, then also the Lobster dyes. And this same Vicissitude of avoiding and pursuing one another, has nature infus'd into them on purpose to exercise their suttlety and understanding.</p>
               <p>Then again we have heard <hi>Aristotimus</hi> relating how the Land Hedge hog had a presentiment of the rising of the Wind, and praising the Triagonal Flight of Cranes. But for my part, I produce no particular Hedge-hog of <hi>Cyzicum</hi> or <hi>Byzantium,</hi> but all the Sea Hedge-hogs in general, who when they perceive a Storm a coming, ballast themselves with little Stones, least they should be overturn'd by reason of their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or carry'd away by the rowling of the Waves,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46328:74"/> which they prevent by the weight of their little Stones.</p>
               <p>On the other side the Cranes order in their flight against the Wind is not of one sort; But this is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Notion among all Fish, that they always swim against the Waves and the Tide, and always take care least the Wind being in their Tails, should force their Fins from their backs, and leave their naked Bodies expos'd to the cold and other inconveniences; and therefore they still oppose the Prows of their Bodies against the Waves. For that while they thus cleave the Waves at the top, the Sea keeps their Fins close, and lightly flowing over the superficies of their Bodies becomes less burthensom, besides that it suffers not their Scales to rise.</p>
               <p>This I say is common to all Fish, except that Fish which is call'd <hi>Ellops;</hi> which as they report always swims with the Wind and Tide, not minding the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or opening of the Scales, the Commissures of which do not lye next the Tail as in other Fish.</p>
               <p>Moreover the <hi>Tunie</hi> is so sensible of the <hi>Equinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solstices,</hi> that they teach even Men themselves without the help of any Astrological Table. For where the Winter Tropics overtake them, there they remain till the <hi>Vernal Equinox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for that same Artifice of the Cranes, that keep themselves waking by clutching a Stone in their Claws, how much more cunningly done is that of the Dolphin; for whom it is not lawful to stand still or be out of Motion: For it is the nature of the Dolphins to be always in Motion; so that when they cease to move, they also cease to live. And therefore when sleep seizes them, they raise their Bodies to the superficies of the Sea, and so sinking down again with their Bellies upward, are carry'd along with the Tide till they touch again the Shoar. Waken'd in that manner,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46328:74"/> with an impetuous noise they mount upward again, designing thus a kind of rest still intermix'd with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the same thing is reported of the <hi>Tunnies</hi> for the same Reason.</p>
               <p>Having thus concluded their Mathematical fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of the Mutations of the Sun, of which <hi>Aristotle</hi> gives Testimony, let me now relate their skill in <hi>Arithmetick;</hi> but first of all their knowledge in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, of which <hi>Eschylus</hi> seems not to have been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant. For these are his Words,
<q>Casting a Squint-eye, like the Tunny.</q> For Tunnies seem to be dim-sighted of one Eye: And therefore they fling themselves into the Water so as to have the Land upon the Right-hand; and go a shoar, so as to have it upon the Left. Prudently committing the care of their Bodies to the best Eye.</p>
               <p>But wanting <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> in order to the Preservation of mutual Love and Society one with another, they arriv'd in such a manner to the perfection of that Science, that in regard they are extreamly desirous to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Society of each other, they always make up their whole Fry into the Form of a <hi>Cube,</hi> and make a solid of the whole Number, consisting of six equal Planes: And then they swim in such order as to observe a due <hi>Plae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium</hi> on both sides. So then if the Observer of the Tunnies does but exactly take the Number of the <hi>Plane,</hi> he knows the whole Number of the shole; well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the depth is equal to the breadth and length. The Fish <hi>Amiae,</hi> which are another sort of <hi>Tunnies</hi> are so call'd, because they swim in sholes, as also the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides,</hi> or Summer Whitings.</p>
               <p>As for the rest that are seen to swim in sholes and to observe a mutual Society, their Number is not to be expres't: And therefore let us proceed to those that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46328:75"/> observe a kind of private and particular Society one with another. Among which is the <hi>Pynnotheras</hi> of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus,</hi> being a certain Fish that diligently observes and watches the Fish call'd the <hi>Nacre,</hi> upon which he has expended so much Ink, that he gives it the precedency in all his Books both Physical and Ethical. For <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus</hi> never knew the <hi>Spongother,</hi> or else he pass'd it over out of negligence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pinnother</hi> is so call'd from watching the she Fish call'd <hi>Pinna</hi> or the <hi>Nacre,</hi> and in shape resembles a Crab, and cohabiting within the <hi>Nacre,</hi> watches the opening of his Shell, and then going forth stays by the open'd and gapping Shell, till he light upon some little Fish which he is able to conquer. Then entring the Shell again, he nips the Flesh of the <hi>Nacre</hi> to give him notice to shut his Shell: Which being done, they feed together within the fortification upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prey.</p>
               <p>The Spunge is govern'd by a certain little Creature more like a Spider then a Crab. For the Spunge wants neither Sense nor Blood; but growing to the Stones as many other things do, has a peculiar Motion from its self, and to it self, which nevertheless stands in need as it were of a Monitor or Instructor. For being otherwise of a Substance loose and open, and full of holes and hollowness, by reason of the sloth and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of it, the <hi>Spunge-watcher</hi> assists to give notice when any thing of Food enters the Cavities of it, at what time the Spunge contracts it self, and falls to feeding. But if a Man approach and touch it, being nipp'd and admonish'd by the <hi>Spunge-watcher,</hi> it seems to shadder and shut up the Body of it, closing and condensing it self in such a manner, as makes it no easie thing to cut it from the place where it grows.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:46328:75"/>
               <p>The <hi>Purple Shell-fish</hi> also, call'd <hi>Porphyrae,</hi> clustring together in a kind of Mutual Society, build up little Combs for themselves like Bees, wherein they are said to generate: and culling out the choicest Substance of the Moss and Sea-weed that sticks to their Shells, they seem to be in a circular Commons among themselves, feeding outwardly the one upon the others Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But why should we admire Society in these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when the most savage and most unsociable of all Creatures which either Lakes, Rivers, or the Ocean nourishes, the Crocodile, shews himself the most Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Grateful of Water-Monsters in the Banquets which he bestows upon the <hi>Trochilus:</hi> For the <hi>Trochilus</hi> is a sort of Water-Fowl, and he Guards and Watches over the Crocodile, not as one that feeds at his Table, but lives upon his scraps and leavings only. For when this Bird observes the <hi>Crocodile</hi> asleep, and the <hi>Ichnenmon</hi> arm'd with mud and dirt ready to assail him, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves crying and pecking him with his Beak, till he rouse the drowsie Monster. In return of which the Crocodile is so tame and gentle toward this Bird, that he permits him to enter his yawning chaps, and is pleas'd with his picking out and cleansing away with his Beak the remainders of the devour'd Flesh that sticks between his Teeth. And when the Monster has an Inclination to shut his Mouth, he gives the Bird notice by a gentle loring of his Jaw, nor will he close his Chaps till he finds that the Bird is flown away. The Fish which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Hegemen</hi> or the Captain or Leader, is a small Fish, in bigness and shape-not much unlike a <hi>Whiting,</hi> but by reason of the roughness of his Scales is said to resemble a Bird when she shakes her Feathers. This Fish always keeps company with the hugeous Whales, and swims before them to direct their course, least they should bruise themselves upon the shallows, or
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46328:76"/> fall into any mershy Place, or narrow Haven, whence he could not easily get out again. Therefore the Whale follows him, as the Ship follows the Helm, directing his course with confidence. All other things whatever, whether Skiff, whether Beast or Stone, that chance to light into the gaping Gulph of the Whales Mouth, immediately perish, being swallow'd by the Monster; but acknowledging his Conductor, he receives him and lodges him like an Anchor safely in his Jaws. There he sleeps, and all the while he takes his rest, the Whale lyes still, and when his Guide comes forth again, the Whale proceeds, never forsaking him night nor day; or if he wander without his Leader, the Monster Ship-wracks, like a Vessel cast upon a Rock, without a Helm. And this we saw not far from <hi>Anticyra,</hi> where they report, that in former times a Whale being cast and putrifying caus'd a Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>Is it worth while then to compare the Observations of Community and Association with those Sympathies which <hi>Aristotle</hi> relates between Foxes and Serpents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Eagle is an Enemy to both? Or of the <hi>Horn-Owles</hi> with Horses, whose dung they love to scrape about the field and nestle in? For my part, I observe no such care of one another in Bees and Emmets, which by reason of their multitude, carry on and perfect their work in common, but have no particular care or consideration one of another. Rather we shall observe this difference more evidently, if we direct our discourses upon the most Ancient and Greatest Works of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Society, which are the works of generation and procreation of Off-spring. For in the first place, those Fish that frequent the shoars next adjoyning to vast Lakes or great Rivers, when they are near their time of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, retire up into those places, seeking the fresh-waters which are more gentle and void of Brine. For
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46328:76"/> Tranquillity is most convenient for such as bring forth; and there is most safety in Rivers and Lakes for their Young Ones as being freest from the devouring Monsters of the Sea. Which is the reason that there is the greatest plenty of Fish about the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea, where there are no Whales but either small Sea-Calves, or little Dolphins. Besides, the mixture of Rivers, many in number, and those very large, that fall into the <hi>Pontus,</hi> make the mixture more kindly and proper for breeding, and bringing forth. And that is most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful which is reported of the <hi>Anthias,</hi> which <hi>Homer</hi> calls the Sacred Fish, though some interpret Sacred to signifie great in that Place, as we call a great Bone <hi>Os sacrum,</hi> and the <hi>Epilepsie,</hi> being a great Disease, the <hi>Sacred Disease;</hi> though others interpret that to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, which ought not to be touch'd, as being dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to holy use. And <hi>Eracostbenes</hi> seems to take the <hi>Gilthead</hi> so call'd from the Golden-Hair about his Eyes, for the Sacred Fish; though many believe it to be <hi>Ellopps</hi> or <hi>Trout,</hi> from her Golden Scales; a Fish sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom seen, and difficult to be caught; yet many times it appears in the Rivers of <hi>Pamphylia.</hi> So that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wn, as having a pledge for their security. And the reason is twofold, either because the Sea-monsters dread the <hi>Anthias,</hi> as Elephants dread a Hog, and Lyons a Cock, or else it is a sign that there are no Sea-monsters in those places, which the <hi>Anthias</hi> knows and observes as being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Fish, endu'd with Sence and a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:46328:77"/>
               <p>Then again the care of their young is common to both Sexes. For the Males never devour their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring; but remain and abide constantly by the Spawn, protecting it with a diligent watchfulness, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> relates; and those that accompany the Females moisten the Spawn with a small quantity of Milky Seed; for that otherwise the Spawn will not grow, but remains imperfect, and never arrives at the due proportion. Particularly the Fish call'd <hi>Phycides, Moles</hi> or <hi>Lepo's</hi> make themselves Nests in the Sea-weed to preserve their Spawn from the Waves.</p>
               <p>But the love of the <hi>Lamprey</hi> or <hi>Pout-Eel</hi> toward her Young Ones is beyond the Affection and Clemency of any the tamest of Creatures; for they lay an Egg, which being hatch'd, they nourish and carry them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout not outwardly, but within their own Bowels, as if they could not breed their Young without a second Birth.</p>
               <p>When the Young Ones are somewhat grown, they put them forth again, and teach them to swim close by themselves, then resume them again through their Mouths into their Bellies, and afford them nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and safe retirement in their Bodys, till they are able to shift for themselves.</p>
               <p>No less admirable is the care of the Tortois as to the bringing forth and preserving her Young. For she retires out of the Sea to lay, but not being able to stay long upon the Land, she hides her Eggs in the Sand, covering them over gently with the lightest of the Gravel, and when she has thus sufficiently and assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceal'd them, some report, that she marks and streaks the place with her Feet, that she may be able to know it again; others affirm, that the Female being driven away by Male, leaves her particular marks and signatures behind her. However it be, this is most wonderful that after an Observation of forty days (for
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46328:77"/> in so many the Eggs come to break) she returns, and knowing where her Treasure lyes, as well as any Man understands where he hides his Gold, she opens them with great Joy and Alacrity.</p>
               <p>Many Observations like to these are made of the Crocodile. But the Superstition of the Place will not allow a Man to dive into the reason of the causes: In regard the foreknowledge of this Creature is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted more to Divinity then Reason. For neither farther nor nearer, but just so far as <hi>Nilus</hi> that Year will increase and cover the Land, thither she goes forth and lays her Eggs: Which the Country-men finding, are able to tell one another how far the River will over-flow that Year, so truly does that animal mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for himself, that tho she live in the Water, she may lay her Eggs dry. But the Young Ones being hatch'd, which soever of them so soon as they are come to life, does not seize whatever comes next, either upon a Flye or a Worm, or a Straw, or a Tufft of Grass with his Mouth, the dam presently tears him to peices with her Teeth. But those that are feirce and active she loves and cherishes, according to the Judgment of the wisest Men, imparting her affection by the Rules of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not the sway of Passion.</p>
               <p>The Sea-calves also bring forth upon the dry Land: but then fetching out their Young ones by degrees, they give them a taste of the Sea-water, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead them out again; and this they often do, till custom has made them bold, and brought them to love a Sea Life.</p>
               <p>Frogs when they couple, use a certain croaking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation which is commonly call'd <hi>Ololygon;</hi> and when the Male has thus intic'd the Female, they abide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all Night. For in the Water they cannot, and in the day time they are afraid to engender upon the Land, which in the Night time they do without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46328:78"/> At other times they croak more shrill and loud, and then it is a sign of Rain, and holds among the most assured Prognostics of wet weather.</p>
               <p>But what an absurdity, dearest <hi>Neptune,</hi> would this Passion of mine lead me into, how ridiculous should I appear, if triffling among Sea-calves and Frogs I should omit one of the Marine Animals, the wisest and most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by the Gods? For what Nightingales are to be compared with the Halcyon for Musick, or who will presume to prefer the Swallows Industry, the Gentleness of the Dove, or the Art and Curiosity of the Bees to those vertues ascrib'd to the Halcyon? One <hi>Island,</hi> as History tells us, in love with <hi>Latonas</hi>'s Birth, receiv'd and entertain'd her. But when the Halcyon brings forth, about the Winter Tropic, the whole Ocean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains calm and undisturb'd without the wrinkle of a Wave. So that there is not any other Creature for which Man has so great an affection, seeing that for her sake for seven days and seven nights together, in the depth of Winter, they sail without fear of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, and make their Voyages upon the Sea with greater safety then they travel upon the Land.</p>
               <p>But if it be requir'd that we should make a brief recital of her particular Vertues, she is so great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Conjugal Affection, that she does not keep company with her Mate for a single season, but for whole years together: and that not for wantoness, for she never couples but with her own, but out of affection and friendship, like a truly vertuous Marry'd Wife. And when her Mate through Age bccomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and not able to bear her Company, she takes care of him, and feeds and carrys him about in his Old Age, never forsaking nor leaving him alone, but taking him upon her Shoulders, carrys him from place to place, never abandoning him till death.</p>

               <p>As to her affection toward her Young ones, and care of their preservation, so soon as she perceives her self near the time of her bringing forth, she presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes her self to the making of her Nest. For the building of which, she neither makes use of Mudd and Durt, nor props it up with Walls and Rafters, like the Swallows, nor does she weary several Members of her Body, like the Bees that employ their whole strength to compleat their labour, and when they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their Cells, toyl together in a narrow compass to divide their Apartments.

This when she has finish'd she launches into the Sea, where the Waves beating gently upon it, direct to reform what is amiss, by consolidating the loose and ill compacted Parts where the Water has forc'd any entrance: Insomuch that at length she fastens and strengthens what she has put together in such a manner, that it is not to be broken or peirc'd either by Stones or Steel. Nor is the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and Form of the inside and cavity of the Nest less to be admir'd. For it is so contriv'd as only to receive her self; the entrance into it not being to be

For the Deity did not swim before his Army in another shape (as the <hi>Mythologists</hi> dream) but sending a Dolphin to direct them in their course, the Dolphin brought them to <hi>Cirrha.</hi> Story also tells us that they who were sent to <hi>Sinope</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy Soter</hi> to fetch from thence <hi>Serapis</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> being driven by contrary Winds upon the Coast of <hi>Malea,</hi> having the <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> upon their right hands, while they were thus wandring and out of their course, a Dolphin appear'd before the Prow of the headmost Vessel, and as it were kindly inviting them, conducted them into safe Harbours and Roads, till by his good guidance and leading them, he at length brought the whole Fleet to <hi>Cyrrha.</hi> There, when they came to offer the usual Sacrifices for their safe landing, they came to understand, that of two Statues which were in the place, they were to take that of <hi>Pluto</hi> and carry it along with them; but as for that of <hi>Proserpina,</hi> they were only to make it clean and leave it behind. Probable it is that the Deity had a kindness for the <hi>Dolphin</hi> considering how much he delights in Music. For which reason <hi>Pindarus</hi> likens himself to the Dolphin, and confesses himself to be mov'd in the same manner as that noble Creature,

                  </q> Tho it is more probable that his Affection to Men is more pleasing to the Deity; being the only Creature that bears an Affection to Man, as he is a Man.

The Swallows by necessity constrain'd build in Houses, seeking shade and security but are no less afraid of Man then the Wild Beasts. Only to the Dolphin has nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd that excellent Quality so much sought for by the best of Philosophers, to love for no advantage. For that having no need at all of Man, he is a kind friend to all Men, and has lent his Assistance to many.

                  </q> For when you had spoken so much in praise of the Dog, you should not have pass'd by the Dolphin. For it was a blind story of the Dog that bark'd and flew with violence upon the Murtherers.

               <p>
                  <hi>Myrtilus</hi> the <hi>Lesbian</hi> writes, that <hi>Enalus</hi> the <hi>Eolian</hi> being in Love with the Daughter of <hi>Phineus,</hi> who by the Command of the Oracle of <hi>Amphitrite,</hi> was cast from the <hi>Penthidian</hi> Rocks, when he understood it, threw himself also into the Sea, but was sav'd by a <hi>Dolphin</hi> and carry'd to <hi>Lesbos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the gentleness and kindness of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Jasean</hi> Lad, was so extraordinary that it might be said to amount even to amorous Love. For he play'd and swam with him in the day time, suffer'd himself to be handl'd and bestrid by him: nor did he swim away with him, but joyfully carry'd him,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46328:80"/> which way soever the Lad by the motion of his body turn'd him, while the <hi>Jaseans</hi> flock'd from all parts to the shoar to behold the sight. At length the Lad being thrown from the Dolphins back by a terrible showr of Rain and Hail, was drown'd. Which the <hi>Dolphin</hi> perceiving, took up the dead Youth, and threw himself upon the Land together with the body, from which he never stirr'd till he dy'd out of his own Element: deeming it but just to pertake of that end of which he seem'd to have been the occasion to his Friend and Play-fellow. Nor can the <hi>Jaseans</hi> forget the Accident, but keep it still in remembrance by the stamp upon their Coyn, which is a <hi>Lad</hi> upon a <hi>Dolphins</hi> back. And from hence it was that the fabulous Stories of <hi>Coeranus</hi> gain'd Credit.</p>
               <p>He was a <hi>Parian</hi> by Birth, who residing at <hi>Byzantium,</hi> at what time a draught of Dolphins caught in a Net, were expos'd to Sale, and in danger of Slaughter, bought them up all, and put them into the Sea again. It happen'd not long after that <hi>Coeranus</hi> took a Voyage in a Vessel of fifty Oars, carrying, as the story, goes several Pyrates. But between <hi>Naxus</hi> and the Bay of <hi>Paros</hi> he suffer'd Shipwrack; and when all the rest were drown'd, he alone was taken up by a <hi>Dolphin</hi> that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten'd to his Succour, and carry'd to <hi>Sycynthos,</hi> and set a shore near the Cave, which to this day bears the name of <hi>Coeraneum.</hi> Upon which <hi>Archilochus</hi> is said to have made these Lines.</p>

                  <p>Hence we must conclude that it is so as the wisest of Men has affirm'd; that there are some things to be prais'd and approv'd, others to be preferr'd by choice and affection. And I suppose you believe the same concerning the Soul. For the same reason holds in reference to the Soul as to the ground; that such

                  <speaker>Gryll.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you confess that the Souls of Beasts are the more perfect, and more fertilly endu'd for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Vertue; seeing that without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Document it produces and increases that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which is requisite for every one.</p>

                  <p>Rather, what Vertues do they not partake of in a higher degree then the wisest of Men? Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Fortitude in the first place of which you vaunt and brag to have such a terrible share, and are not asham'd of the magnificent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>itles of <hi>Æ²lysses</hi> the <hi>Bold,</hi> and <hi>City-Stormer,</hi> when indeed like a pitiful Knave, as thou art, thou dost only circumvent by Tricks and Artifices Men that only understand the simple and generous way of making War, ignorant altogether of Fraud and Faith-breaking, and by that means cover'st thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit with the name of <hi>Vertue</hi> which never admits of any such Coney-catching Devices. But you observe the Combats and Warfare of Beasts as well one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another as against your selves, how free from Craft and Deceit they are, and how with an open and naked Courage they defend themselves by meer strength of Body; and how neither afraid of the Law that calls them forth to Battle, nor the severe Edicts against Desertors, but only out of scorn to be overcome, they fight with obstinacy to the last for Conquest and Victory. For they are not vanquish'd when their Bodies are worsted, neither does despair cowardize them, but they dye upon the spot: And you shall see many times that the strength of many, while expiring, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd and crowded together in some part of the body, still makes resistance against the Victor, and pants
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46328:84"/> and fumes till at length it fails like extinguish'd Fire that goes out for want of Fuel. But there is no crying for Quarter, no begging of Mercy; no acknowledgment of being beaten; nor will the Lyon be a slave to the Lyon, nor the Horse to the Horse, as one Man is a slave to another, willing and patiently embracing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, the effect of fear and cowardice. On the other side such Beasts as Men by Nets and treacherous Snares get into their Power, if fully grown, they rather choose to dye then serve, refusing Nourishment and suffering extremity of Drought. But as for their young Ones, being tractable and supple by reason of their Age, and fed with the deceitful mixtures and food that Men provide for them, their inbred fierceness languishing through the taste of preternatural Delights, they suffer that which is call'd Domestication, which is only an Effeminating of their natural fury. Whence it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that Beasts are naturally inclin'd to be couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and daring, but that the martial confidence of Men is preternatural. Which most noble <hi>Æ²<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ysses</hi> you may chiefly observe from hence: for that in Beasts, Nature keeps an equal ballance of Strength: so that the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male being but little Inferior to the Male, undergoes all necessary toils, and fights in defence of her young Ones. And thus you hear of a certain <hi>Cromyonian</hi> Sow, which tho a Female held <hi>Theseus</hi> tack, and found him work sufficient. Neither had the Wisdom of that same Female <hi>Sphynx</hi> that pester'd <hi>Phycium</hi> with her Riddles and <hi>Enigma</hi>'s avail'd her, had she not far excell'd the <hi>Cadmaeans</hi> in Strength and Fortitude. Not far from whence the <hi>Telmesian</hi> Fox had his Den, a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder of Questions also; not to omit the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Serpent that fought with <hi>Apollo</hi> for his Oracle at <hi>Delphos.</hi> Your King also took the Mare <hi>Aetha</hi> from the <hi>Sicyonian</hi> as a bribe to discharge him from going to the Wars, to shew how much he esteem'd a valiant
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46328:84"/> and generous Mare above a timorous Coward. You your self have also seen Female Panthers and Lionesses little Inferior to the Males in Strength and Courage: when your own Wife, tho a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> when you were hectoring and blustering abroad, sate at home in the Chimney-Corner, not daring to encounter the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that plagu'd both her and her Family. Whence it is apparent that Fortitude is not natural to Men, for then the Women, would pertake of it. So that the Fortitude which you exercise is only constrain'd by Law, not natural and voluntary, but subservient to the manners of the Place, and enslav'd to reproach; a thing made up only of glorious Words and adventitious Opinion: And you undergo labour, and throw your selves into danger, not out of a real Valour and Boldness, but because ye are more afraid of the other. Therefore as among thy own Companions, he that first makes hast to snatch up the light Oar, does it not because he contemns it, but because he is loath to be troubl'd with the more heavy, so he that endures a blow to avoid a wound, and defends himself against an Enemy to preserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from Wounds and Death, does it not out of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring courage a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ainst the one, but out of fear of the other. Thus your Fortitude is only a prudent fear; and your Courage, a knowing Timidity, which understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly does one thing to avoid another. In short, if you believe your selves superior to the Beasts in Fortitude, why do your Poets call those that behave themselves most valiantly against their Enemies <hi>Wolf breasted, Lyon-hearted,</hi> and compare them to Wild-boars? but never call'd the Courage of Lyons <hi>Man-like,</hi> or resembl'd the Strength of a Wild-boar to that of a Man. But as they call the swift <hi>Wind-footed,</hi> and the beautiful <hi>Godlike-form'd,</hi> hyperbolizing in their Similies; so when they extol the Gallantry of the stout in Battle, they derive their Comparisons from the Superior in Bravery.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46328:85"/> The reason is because Courage is as it were the tincture and edge of Fortitude; which the Beasts make use of unmix'd in their Combats, but in you being mix'd with Reason, like Wine diluted with Water, it gives way to danger, and looses the opportunity. And some of you there are who deny that Courage is requisite in Battle, and therefore laying it aside, make use of sober Reason; which they do well for their preservation, but are shamefully beside the cushion in point of Strength and Revenge. How absurd therefore is it for you to complain of Nature because she did not furnish your Bodies with Goades, and Teeth, and crooked Claws to defend your selves, when at the same time you would disarme the Soul of her natural Weapons?</p>

                  <p>In good truth, <hi>Gryllus,</hi> you are grown, in my conceit, a notable Sophister, to discourse at this rate out of a Hogs snout, and yet to handle your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so strenuously. But why have you not all this while spoke a word of Temperance.</p>

                  <speaker>Gryll.</speaker>
                  <p>Because I thought you would have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted first what I have already said. But you are in hast to hear what I have to say concerning Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, because that being the Husband of a most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and chast Wife, you believe you have set us an Example of Temperance by abstaining from <hi>Circe</hi>'s Embraces; and yet in this you differ nothing from all the Beasts; for neither do they desire to approach their Superiors; but pursue their Pleasures and Amours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those of their own Tribe.</p>
                  <p>No wonder is it then, if like the <hi>Mendesian</hi> Goat in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is reported to have been shut up with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral and those most beautiful Women, yet never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd copulation with them, but when he was at liberty with a lustful fury flew upon the she Goats; so thou, tho a Man addicted greatly to Venereal Pleasures, yet being a Man, hast no desire to sleep with a Goddess.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46328:85"/> And for the Chastity of thy <hi>Penelope</hi> the ten thousand Rooks and Daws that chatter it abroad do but make it ridiculous and expose it to Contempt, there being not one of those Birds but if she looses her Mate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues a Widow not for a small time, nor for nine Ages of Men: so that there is not one of those Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Rooks that does not surpass in chastity thy fair <hi>Penelope</hi> above nine times.</p>
                  <p>But because thou believest me to be a Sophister, I shall observe a certain order in my Discourse, first gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thee the Definition of Chastity, and then dividing Desire according to the several kinds of it. Chastity then is the contracting and well governing our desires, pruning off those that are superfluous and incroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Wills, and ruling those that are necessary by the Standards of Season and Moderation. Now in desires you observe a vast number of Distinctions; as it is both natural and necessary to drink. But as for Venereal Desires, which derive their Originals from Nature; there is a time when they may be refrain'd without any inconvenience: These are therefore call'd Physical and not natural. But there is another sort which are neither natural, nor necessary, but infus'd from without by vain Opinion through the mistake of right and true; and these are they that want but very little of ruining all your natural desires with their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, like a multitude of Foreigners outnumbring the Natives, and expelling them from their Habitations. But the Beasts having their Souls unmix'd, and not to be overcome by these Adventitious Passions; and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Lives as distant from vain Opinion as from the Sea, are inferior to you in living elegantly and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluously: but they are extreamly wary in the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Chastity, and the right Government of their Desires, as being neither troubl'd with many, nor those Foreign to their Natures: and therefore formerly I was no less smitten with the Glister of Gold then
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46328:86"/> thou art now, as believing nothing else that a Man could possess to be comparable to it. Silver also and Ivory inveagl'd me with the same desires; and he that enjoy'd these things in the greatest measure seem'd to be a Man most happy and belov'd of God, whether a <hi>Phrygian</hi> or a <hi>Carian,</hi> whether more meanly descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then <hi>Dolo,</hi> or more miserable then <hi>Priamus.</hi> From thence forward being altogether sway'd by my desires, I reap'd no other pleasure nor delight in any other Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of my Life, with which I abounded, believing that I wanted still and mist my share of those that were the chiefest and the greatest. Therefore I remember, when I beheld thee in <hi>Creet,</hi> at some Solemnity, most pompously attired, I neither envy'd thy Wisdom, nor thy Vertue, but the extraordinary fineness and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Workmanship of thy <hi>Tunic,</hi> and the glystering of thy Purple upper Garment, and the Beauty of the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that strook me with admiration: and the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Clasp, me thought, was a pritty Toy that had something of extraordinary Graving in it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd with these Baubles I follow'd thee as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did. But now being altogether estrang'd from those vain Opinions, and having my understanding pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd I tread both Gold and Silver under my feet as I do the common Stones: nor did I ever sleep more soundly upon thy Carpets and Tapestries, then now I do, rowl'd over head and ears in the deep and soft Mud. None of those adventitious desires reside in our Souls; but for the most part our manner of living is accustom'd to necessary Pleasures and Desires: and as for those pleasures which are not necessary but only natural, we make such a use of them as is neither without order nor moderation. And therefore let us consider these in the first place.</p>
                  <p>The Pleasure then, that affects the sence of smelling with sweet Odors and fragant Exhalations besides that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46328:86"/> it has something in it, which is pure in it self, and as it were bestow'd upon us <hi>gratis,</hi> contributes also in some measure to the distinction of nourishment. For the Tongue is said to be the Judge of sweet, sowre and tart, when the several juyces intermix'd with the distinguishing taste, undergo a kind of separation. But our smell, before the taste, becoming sensible of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and qualities of every one, and being more accurate then the Tasters attending upon Princes, admits what is familiar to Nature, and expells whatever is disagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it: Neither will it suffer it to touch or molest the taste, but accuses and declares the offensiveness of the thing smelt, before it do any harm. As to other things they breed no disturbance to it, constraining ye for the sake of the sweet scents of Cinnamon, Nard, Cephalic Herbs, and <hi>Aromatic</hi> Reed, to seek out for things dissimilar, and jumble them together with a kind of Apothecaries or Perfumers Art, and at vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to purchase an unmanly and effeminat delighte, for nothing profitable or useful. Now being such, this sence of smelling has not only corrupted all the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Sex, but the greatest part of Men, insomuch that they care not to converse with their own Wives, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Perfum'd with precious Oyntments, and Odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous compositions. Whereas Sows, she Goats and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Females attract the Boars, he Goats, and the males of their own kind by their own proper Scents; and the smell of the pure Dew, the Meadows and Grass incites them to copulation out of common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; the Females, without the Coynesses of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or the practice of little Frauds and Fascinations to inflame the lust of their Mates: nor are the Males, with amorous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>age and frienzy stimulated, enforc'd to purchase the Act of Generation with expensive hire or servile Assiduity, enjoying their seasonable Amours without deceit, or purchase of the satisfaction of their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46328:87"/> Venery; which at such a time of the Year, like the Buds of Plants, awaking their desire, is presently quencht again, neither the Female admitting the Male, nor the Male attempting the Female after Conception. And thus Pleasure has but a small and slender esteem among us. So that even to this very day we Beasts were never tainted yet with coupling Male with Male, and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male with Female. Of which nevertheless there are many Examples to be produc'd among the greatest and most celebrated Persons: For I pass by those not worth remembrance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agamemnon</hi> hunted all <hi>Boeotia</hi> in pursuit of <hi>Argynus</hi> who fled his Embraces, and after he had falsly accus'd the Sea and Winds, flung himself bravely no less brave into the Lake <hi>Copais,</hi> to quench his Love, and free himself from the Ardor of his Lust.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hercules</hi> in like manner pursuing his Beardless Friend, forsook his choicest Associates, and betray'd the Fleet.</p>
                  <p>In the Supping Room belonging to <hi>Apollo</hi> Sirnam'd <hi>Ptous,</hi> one of your Country-men unknown, wrote this Inscription, <hi>Achilles the fair;</hi> when <hi>Achilles</hi> at that time had a Son: And I hear the Inscription is still remaining. Yet if a Cock tread a Cock, in the absence of the Hen, he is burnt alive, upon the signification of the South sayer that it portends some fatal calamity. Which is a plain confession in Men themselves, that the Beasts excel them in chastity, and that Force is not to be put upon Nature for the sake of Pleasure. But your incontinence is such, that Nature, though she have the Law to assist her, is not able to keep it within Bounds; insomuch that like a rapid inundation, those inordinate desires overwhelm Nature with continual violence, trouble and confusion. For Men have copulated with she Goats, Sows and Mares: And Women have run Mad after Male Beasts: And from such Capulations
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46328:87"/> sprang the <hi>Minotaurs</hi> and <hi>Silvans,</hi> and as I am apt to believe, the <hi>Sphinxes</hi> and <hi>Centaurs.</hi> 'Tis true that sometimes constrain'd by hunger, a Dog or a Bird has fed upon human Flesh, but never yet did any Beast at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to couple with human Kind. But Men constrain and force the Beast to these and many other unlawful Pleasures.</p>
                  <p>Now being thus wicked and incontinent in reference to the aforesaid lustful desires, it is no less easie to be prov'd that Men are more intemperate then Beasts, even in those things which are necessary; that is to say, in eating and drinking; the pleasure of which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enjoy with some benefit to our selves: But you pursuing the pleasure of eating and drinking beyond the satisfaction of Nature, are punish'd with many and tedious Diseases, which arising from the single Fountain of superfluous gourmandizing, fill your Bodies with all manner of wind and vapors not easie for purgation to expel. In the first place, all sorts of Beasts according to their kind feed upon one sort of food which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their Natures; some upon Grass, some upon Roots, and others upon Fruits. They that feed upon Flesh never mind any other sort of Food. Neither do they rob the weaker Animals of their nourishment: But the Lyon suffers the Hart, the Wolf permits the Sheep to feed upon what Nature has provided for them. But Man, such is his voracity, falls upon all, to satisfie the pleasures of his Appetite, tryes all things, tastes all things; and as if he were yet to seek what was the most proper Dyet and most agreeable to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, among all the Creatures is the only <hi>All devourer.</hi> And first he makes use of Flesh, not for want, as having the liberty to take his choice of Herbs and Fruits, the plenty of which is inexhaustible; but out of luxury and being cloy'd with necessaries, seeks after inconvenient and impure Dyet purchas'd by the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46328:88"/> of living Creatures; by that meanes, shewing himself more cruel then the most Savage of Wild Beasts. For Blood, Murder and Flesh are proper to nourish the Kite, the Wolf and Dragon, but to Man they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious viands. Then making use of all, he does not do like the Beasts, which abstain from most Creatures, and only are at enmity with a few, and that only compell'd by the necessities of hunger; but neither Fowl, nor Fish, nor any thing that lives upon the Land escape your Tables, though they bear the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites of <hi>Human</hi> and <hi>Hospitable.</hi> Let it be so: That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will serve ye but to devour whatever comes near ye to pamper and indulge your voracious Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. Yet where's the benefit and pleasure of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual gourmandizing, considering how you are forc'd to toyl and labor for unprofitable experience? But such is the prudence of the Beasts as not to admit of any vain and unprofitable Arts: And as for those that are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, they do not acquire them as being introduc'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or taught for reward; neither do they make it their study to soder and fast'n one contemplation to another, but they are supply'd by their own prudence with such as are true born and genuine. 'Tis true, we hear the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are generally Physicians. But the Beasts are not only every one of them nationally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ndu'd with knowledge and Art which way to cure themselves, but also to procure their Food, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair their strength; to catch their prey by slight and cunning, to guard themselves from danger; neither are some of them ignorant how to teach the Science of Music so far as is convenient for <hi>Them.</hi> For from whom did we learn to run to the Rivers when we are Sick, to search for <hi>Crey-fish</hi> but from the Hogs? Who taught the Tortoises when they have eaten Vipers, to Physic themselves with <hi>Basill?</hi> Who taught the <hi>Cretan</hi> Goats, when shot with Arrows that stick in their Bodys, to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46328:88"/> betake themselves to Dittany? Which they have no sooner eaten, but the Heads of the Darts fall out of the Wound. Now if you say that Nature is the School-Mistress that teaches them these things, you acknowledge the prudence of Beasts to be deriv'd from the cheifest and wisest Original of Understanding. Which if you think not proper to call reason and wisdom, 'tis time for ye to find out a more glorious and honourable name for it; as indeed by its effects it shews it self to be greater and more wonderful in power: Not illiterate or without Education, but instructed by its self, and wanting nothing from without; not weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, but through the vigour and perfection of its natural vertue, supporting and cherishing that natural contribution of understanding which others attain to by Instruction and Education. So that whatever Men acquire and contemplate in the midst of their luxury and wantonness, those things our understanding attains to, through the excellency of our apprehensions, even contrary to the Nature of the Body. For not to speak of Whelps that learn to draw dry Foot, and Colts that will Practice Figure Dances, there are Crows that will speak, and Dogs that will leap through Hoops as they turn round. You shall also see Horses and Bulls upon the Theatres lye down, dance, stop and move their Bodies after such a manner, as would puzzle even Men to perform the same things; which though they are of little use, yet being learnt and remember'd by Beasts, is a great Argument of their Docility.</p>
                  <p>If you doubt whether we learn Arts; he convinces you that we teach them. For Patridges teach their Young Ones to hide themselves by lying upon their Backs just before a clod of Earth, to escape the pursuit, of the Fowlers. And you shall observe the Old Storks when their Young Ones first begin to take Wing, what care they take to instruct them upon the Tops of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46328:89"/> Houses. Nightingales also teach their Young Ones to Sing: Insomuch that Nightingales taken Young out of the Nest, and Bred up by Hand in Cages, sing worse, as being depriv'd of their Instructors before their time. So that after I had been a while transform'd into this shape I admired at my self, that I was so easily perswaded by idle Arguments of the Sophisters, to believe that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures were void of sense and reason except Man.</p>

                  <hi>Plutarch's Morals: Vol. V.</hi> Of the Face, appearing within the Orb of the Moon. Translated out of the <hi>Greek</hi> by <hi>A. G.</hi> Gent. The Beginning of this Discourse is lost.</head>
               <p>THese things then, said <hi>Sylla.</hi> For it agrees with my Story, and is taken thence. But I should first willingly ask, what need there is of making such a Preamble against these Opinions, which are at hand, and in every Mans Mouth, concerning the Face, that is seen within the Orb of the Moon. Why should we not, <hi>said I,</hi> being by the Difficulty, there is in these Discourses, forc'd upon those? For as they, who have long lain lingring under chronical Diseases, after they have been worn out and tir'd with experimenting all ordinary Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the usual Rules of Living, and Diet, have at last Recourse to Lustrations and Purifications, to Charms and Amulets fastned about the Neck, and to the Interpretation of Dreams: so in such obscure, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46328:90"/> Questions and Speculations, when the common, apparent, and ordinary Reasons are not satisfactory, there is a necessity of trying such as are more extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and of not contemning, but enchanting our selves, as one may say, with the Discourses of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and endeavoring always to find out the Truth. For you see at the very first Blush, how impertinent his Opinion is, who said, that the Form, appearing in the Moon, is an Accident of our Sight, by its Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness giving way to her Brightness, which we call the Dazling of our Eyes: for he perceives not, that this should rather befall our Looking against the Sun, whose Lustre is more resplendent, and his Rays more quick and piercing, as <hi>Empedocles</hi> also in a certain Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of his, has not unpleasantly noted the difference of these two Planets, saying:

                     </note> gently-shining Moon:</q> For thus does he call her alluring, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable, and harmless Light. No less ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd appears the Reason, he afterwards gives, why dull and weak Eyes discern no difference of Form in the Moon, her Orb appearing to them plain and smooth; whereas those, whose Sight is more acute and penetrating, better descry the Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and more perfectly observe the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of a Face, and more evidently distinguish its different Parts. For it should, in my Opinion, be quite contrary, if this were a Fancy, caus'd by the Weakness of the vanquish'd Sight: so that where the Patients Eye is weaker, the Appearance would be more express and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. Moreover, the Inequality every way confutes this Reason: for this Face is not seen in a continuate
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46328:90"/> and confus'd Shadow; but the Poet <hi>Agesianax</hi> not unelegantly describes it, saying,
<q>
                     <l>With shining Fire, it circled deos appear,</l>
                     <l>And in the midst is seen the Visage clear</l>
                     <l>Of a young Maid, whose Eye's more gray than blew,</l>
                     <l>Her Brow and Cheeks a blushing Red do shew.</l>
                  </q> For indeed dark and shady things, encompass'd with others, that are bright and shining, sink underneath, and reciprocally rise again, being repell'd by them, and, in a Word, they are so interlac'd one within another, that they represent the Figure of a Face painted to the Life: and there seems to have been great Probability in that, which was spoken against <hi>Clearchus</hi> by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who appears not inconveniently to be call'd yours. For this <hi>Aristotle</hi> of yours was intimately acquainted with the ancient one, althÃ´ he perverted many of the <hi>Peripatetic</hi> Doctrins.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Apollonides</hi> taking up the Discourse, and asking, what that Opinion of <hi>Clearchus</hi> was: It would more, said I, beseem any Man, than you, to be ignorant of this Discourse, as being grounded on the very fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principles of Geometry. For he affirms, that what we call a Face, are the Images and Figures of the great <hi>Ocean,</hi> represented in the Moon, as in a Mirror. For the Circumference of a Circle, being every way reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, is wont to deceive the Sight in such things, as cannot be directly seen. And the full Moon is for Evenness and Lustre the most beautiful and purest of all Mirrors. As then you hold, that the Heavenly Bow ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, when the Light is reflected back towards the Sun in a Cloud, that has got a little liquid Smoothness and Consistence: so, said he, there is seen in the Moon the Surface of the Sea, not in the Place, where it is situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but from whence the Refraction gives a Sight of it
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46328:91"/> by its reverberated and reflexed Light, as <hi>Agesianax</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain says in another Passage:
<q>
                     <l>This flaming Mirror offers to your Eyes</l>
                     <l>The vast Seas Figure, as beneath it lies</l>
                     <l>Foaming with raging Billows.â€”</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollonides</hi> therefore, being delighted with this, said: A singular Opinion indeed is this of his, and, to speak in a Word, strangely and newly invented by a Man, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently presumptuous, but not void of Learning and Wit. But how, I pray, was it refuted?</p>
               <p>First, said I, if the Superficies of the Sea is all of a Nature, the Current of it must be uniform and continuate, but the Appearance of those black and dark Spots, which are seen in the Face of the Moon, is not continu'd, but it has certain Isthmes or Partitions clear and bright, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and separate what is dark and shady. Whence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Place being distinguisht, and having its own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits apart, the Approachings of the Clear to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, taking a Resemblance of High and Low, express and represent the Similitude of a Figure, seeming to have Eyes and Lips: so that we must of necessity sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, either that there are many Oceans and main Seas, distinguish'd by Isthmes and Continents of firm Land, which is evidently absurd and false; or that if there is but one, 'tis not credible, its Image should appear so distracted and dissipated by pieces; and as for this, 'tis more secure, and there is less Danger in asking, than in affirming in your Presence: Whether the habitable Earth being equal in Length and Breadth, it is possible, that all the Sight, reflected and sent back by the Moon, should equally touch the whole Ocean, and those that sail, and dwell in it, as do the <hi>Britains:</hi> especially since the Earth, as you have maintain'd, has but the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Point, if compar'd to the Sphere of the Moon.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46328:91"/> This therefore, said I, 'tis your Business to observe, but the Refraction of the Sight against the Moon belongs neither to you nor <hi>Hipparchus.</hi> And yet, my Friend <hi>Lamprias,</hi> there are many Naturalists, who approve not this Doctrine of his touching the driving back of the Sight; but affirm it to be more probable, that it has a certain obedient and agreeing Temperature and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactness of Structure than such Beatings and Repercussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> feign'd for his Atoms. Nor am I of Opinion, that <hi>Clearchus</hi> would have us suppose the Moon not to be a massy and weighty Body, but a celestial and light-giving Star, against which, you say, this Refracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Sight should reach: so that all this Reflection and Reverberation comes to nothing. But if we are desir'd to receive and admit it, we shall ask why this Face or Image of the Sea is to be seen only in the Body of the Moon, and not in any of the other Stars? For the Laws of Probability require, that the Sight should suffer this equal in all, or else in none.</p>
               <p>But pray, Sir, said I, casting mine Eyes upon <hi>Lucius,</hi> call a little to mind, what was said at first by those of our Party.</p>
               <p>Nay rather, answer'd he, lest we should seem too injurious to <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> in thus passing by the Opinion of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> without opposing any thing against it, let us make some Reply to this Man, who supposes the Moon to be wholly a Mixture of Air and mild Fire: and then says, that, as in a Calm there sometimes arises on a sudden a Breez of Wind, which curls and ruffles the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Sea, so, the Air being Darkned and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd black, there is an Appearance and Form of a Face.</p>
               <p>You do courteously, <hi>Lucius,</hi> said I, thus to vail and cover with specious Expressions so absurd and false an Opinion. But so did not our Friend, but said, as the Truth is, that the <hi>Stoicks</hi> disfigur'd and mortify'd the Moons Face, filling it with Stains and black Spots, one while invocating her by the Name of <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:46328:92"/> and another while making her a Lump and Mixture of dark Air and Char-coal Fire, not kindling of it self, or having any Light of its own, but a Body hard to be judg'd and known, always smoaking, and ever burning, like to those Thunders, which are by the Poets stil'd lightless and sooty. Now, that a Fire of Coals, such, as they would have that of the Moon to be, cannot have any Continuance, nor yet so much as the least Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, unless it meets with some solid Matter, fit to maintain it, keep it in, and feed it, has, I think, far better than it is by these Philosophers, been understood by those Poets, who in merriment affirm, that <hi>Vulcan</hi> was therefore said to be lame, because Fire can no more go forward without Wood or Fewel, than a Criple without a Crurch. If then the Moon is Fire, whence has it so much Air? For that Region above, which is with a continual Motion carry'd round, consists not of Air, but some more excellent Substance, whose Nature it is to subtilize and set on fire all other things. And if it has been since engendred there, how comes it, that it does not perish, being chang'd and transmuted by the Fire into an aethereal and heavenly Substance? And how can it maintain and preserve it self, cohabiting so long with the Fire, as a Nail always fixt and fasten'd in one and the same Place? For being rare, and diffus'd, as by Nature it is, 'tis not fitted for Permanency and Continuance, but for Change and Dissipation; neither is it possible, that it should condense and grow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, being mixt wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And since the Swiftness and Violence of Motion is wont to enflame the Air, which is in Stones, and even in Lead it self, as cold as it is: much more will it that, which, being in Fire, is with so great an Impetuosity whirl'd about. For they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46328:92"/> with <hi>Empedocles</hi> for making the Moon a Mass of Air, conge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And yet they themselves say, that the Moon, being a Globe of Fire, contains in it much Air dispers'd here and there; and this, thÃ´ it has neither Ruptures, Concavities, nor Depths (which they, who affirm it to be earthy, admit;) but the Air lies superficially on its Convexity. Now this is both against the Nature of Permanency, and impossible to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, with what we see in full Moons: for it should not appear separately black and dark, but either be wholly obscur'd and conceal'd, or else co-illuminated, when the Moon is overspread by the Sun. For with us the Air, which is in the Pits and Hollows of the Earth, whither the Rays of the Sun cannot penetrate, remains d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For it is by reason of its Rarity easily transform'd into every Quality and Faculty, but principally of Light and Brightness, by which, being never so little toucht, it incontinently changes, and is illuminated. This Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son therefore, as it seems greatly to help and maintain the Opinion of those, who thrust the Air into certain deep Valleys and Caves in the Moon: so it confutes you, who mix and compose her Sphere, I know not how, of Air and Fire. For it is not possible, that there should remain any Shadow or Darkness in the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Moon, when the Sun with his Brightness clears and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens, whatsoever we can discern of her, and cut with our Sight.</p>
               <p>Whilst I was yet speaking, <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> interrupting my Discourse, said: See here again the usual Stratagem of the Academy, brought into play against us, which is to busy themselves at every turn in speaking against others, but never to afford an Opportunity for reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what they say themselves: so that those, with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46328:93"/> whom they confer and dispute, must always be Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Defendants, and never Plaintiffs or Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents. You shall not therefore bring me this Day to give you any Account of those things, you charge upon the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> till you have first rendred me a Reason for your turning the World upside down.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Lucius</hi> smiling, said: This, good Sir, I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to do, provided only, that you will not accuse us of Impiety, as <hi>Aristarchus</hi> thought, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> ought to have call'd <hi>Cleanthes</hi> the <hi>Samian</hi> into question, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd him of Blasphemy against the Gods, as shaking the very Foundations of the World, because this Man, endeavoring to save the Appearances, suppos'd, that the Heavens remain'd immovable, and that the Earth mov'd thrÃ´ the oblique Circle of the Zodiack, turning about its Axle tree. As for us therefore, we say nothing, that we take from them. But how do they, my good Friend, who suppose the Moon to be Earth, turn the World upside down, more than you, who say, that the Earth remains here hanging in the Air, being much greater than the Moon, as the Mathematicians measure their Magnitude by the Accidents of Eclipses, and by the Passages of the Moon thrÃ´ the Shadow of the Earth, gathering thence, how great a Space it takes up? For the Shadow of the Earth is less than it self, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is cast by a greater Light. And that the end of this Shadow upwards is slender and pointed, they say, that <hi>Homer</hi> himself was not ignorant, but plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd it, when he call'd the Night <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, acute, from the sharp pointedness of the Earths Shadow. And yet the Moon in her Eclipses, being caught within this Point of the Shadow, can scarce get out of it by going forward thrice her own Bigness in Length. Consider then, how many times the Earth must needs be greater than the Moon, if it casts a Shadow, the narrowest Point of which is thrice as broad as the Moon. But
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46328:93"/> you are perhaps afraid, lest the Moon should fall, if it were acknowledg'd to be Earth; but as for the Earth, <hi>Aeschylus</hi> has secur'd you, when he says that <hi>Atlas</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Like a firm Pillar, Heav'n and Earth sustains,</l>
                     <l>Whilst on his Back a heavy Weight remains.</l>
                  </q> If then there runs under the Moon only a light Air, not firm enough to bear a solid Burthen, whereas under the Earth there are, as <hi>Pindar</hi> says, Columns and Pillars of Adamant for its Support: and therefore <hi>Pharnaces</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is out of all dread of the Earths falling; but he pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> and those of <hi>Taprobane,</hi> who ly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under the Course of the Moon, fearing, lest so ponderous a Mass should tumble upon their Heads. And yet the Moon has, for an help to preserve her from falling, her Motion, and the Impetuosity of her Revolution: As Stones, Pebbles, and other Weights, put into Slings, are kept from dropping out, whilst they are swung round, by the swiftness of their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For every Body is carry'd according to its natural Motion, unless it be diverted by some other interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cause. Wherefore the Moon does not move ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Motion of her Weight, her Inclination being stopt and hindred by the Violence of a circulary Revolution. And perhaps there would be more reason to wonder, if the Moon continu'd always immoveable in the same Place, as does the Earth. But now the Moon has a great Cause to keep her from tending hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther downwards; but for the Earth, which has no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motion, 'tis probable, that it has also no other Cause of its Settlement, but its own weight. For the Earth is heavier than the Moon, not only because it is greater, but also because the Moon is rendred lighter by the Heat and Inflammation, that is in it. In brief, it appears by what you say, if 'tis true, that the Moon
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46328:94"/> is Fire, it stands in need of Earth, or some other Matter, which it may rest on, and cleave to, for the maintaining and nourishing of its Power. For 'tis not possible to imagine, how a Fire can be preserv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some combustible Matter: and you your selves say, that the Earth continues firm without any Basis or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destal, to support it.</p>
               <p>Yes surely, said <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> being in its proper and natural Place, the very middle and Center of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. For this it is, to which all heavy and ponderous things do from every side naturally tend, incline, and aspire, and about which they cling, and are counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pois'd. But every superior Region, thÃ´ it may perhaps receive some earthly and weighty thing, sent by violence up into it, immediately repels and casts it down again by force, or, to speak better, lets it follow its own proper Inclination, by which it naturally tends downwards.</p>
               <p>For the Refutation of which being willing to give <hi>Lucius</hi> time for the calling to mind his Arguments, I address'd my self to <hi>Theon,</hi> and ask'd him, which of the Tragick Poets it was, who said, that Physicians

Does it not thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Earth is sphaerical and round, as a Ball, thÃ´ we nevertheless see it to have so many lofty Hills,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46328:94"/> so many deep Vallies, and so great a Number of Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities? Does it not follow that there are <hi>Antipodes,</hi> dwelling opposite to one another, sticking on every side to the Earth, with their Heads downwards, and their Heels upwards, as if they were Wood-worms or Cats, hanging by their Claws? That we our selves go not on the Earth strait upright, and rectangular, but obliquely, and bending aside, like drunken Men? That if Bars and Weights of a thousand Talents a piece should be let fall into the Hollow of the Earth, they would, when they were come to the Center or Middle, stop and rest there, thÃ´ nothing came against them, or sustain'd them, and that, if peradventure they should by force pass the Middle, they would of themselves return and rebound back thither again? That if one should saw off the two Trunks or Ends of a Beam on either side of the Earth, they would not be always carry'd downwards, but falling both from without into the Earth, they would equally meet and hide themselves together in the Middle? That, if a violent Stream of Water should run downwards into the Ground, it would, when it came to the Center in the midst, which they hold to be an incorporeal Point, there gather together, and turn round like a Whirl-pool, hanging about a Pole, with a perpetual and endless Suspension? Some of which Positions are so absurd, that none can so much as force his Imagination, thÃ´ falsly, to conceive them possible. For this is indeed to make that, which is above, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and to turn all things upside down, by placing that, which is in the Middle, beneath, and that, which is under the Middle, above: so that, if a Man should by the Suffrance and Consent of the Earth stand with his Navel just against her Middle or Center, he would by this means have his Foot and Head both upwards; and if one, having digg'd thrÃ´ that place, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Middle, should come to pull him out from
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46328:95"/> thence, that Part, which is below, would at one and the same time be drawn upwards, and that, which is above, downwards. And if another should be imagin'd to stand the contrary way, their Feet, thÃ´ the ones were opposite to the others, would both be, and be said to be upwards.</p>
               <p>Bearing then upon their Shoulders, and drawing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, I do not say a little Bag or Box, but a whole Pack of Juglers Boxes, full of so many Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with which they play the <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, they nevertheless accuse others of Error, for placing the Moon, which they hold to be Earth, on high, and not in the Middle or Center of the World. And yet if every heavy Body inclines towards the same Place, and does from all sides, and with every one of its Parts tend to its Middle or Center, the Earth certainly will not appropriate and challenge to its self these ponderous Masses, which are its Parts, because it is the Center of the Universe, but rather because it is the Whole: and this gathering together of heavy Bodies round about it will not be a Sign, shewing it to be the middle of the World; but an Argument, to prove and testify, that these Bodies which had been pluckt from it, and again return to it, have a Communication and Conformity of Nature with the Earth. For as the Sun changes into himself the Parts, of which he is compos'd: so the Earth receives a Stone, as a Part belonging to it, in such manner, that every one of these things is in time uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and incorporated with it. And if peradventure there is some other Body, which was not from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning allotted to the Earth, nor has been separated from it, but had its own proper and peculiar Consistence and Nature apart, as these Men may say of the Moon, what hinders, but it may continue separated by it self, being kept close, compacted, and bound together by its own Parts? For they do not demonstrate, that the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46328:95"/> Earth is the Middle of the Universe: and this Conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of heavy Bodies, which are here, and their Coalition with the Earth, shew us the manner, how it is probable, that the Parts, which are assembled in the Body of the Moon, continue also there. But as for him, who drives and ranges together in one Place all earthly and ponderous things, making them Parts of one and the same Body; I wonder, that he does not attribute also the same Necessity and Constraint to light Substances, but leaves so many Conglobations of Fire separated from one another; nor can I see, why he should not amass together all the Stars, and think, that there ought to be but one Body of all those Substances, which fly upwards.</p>

You plainly see, it would be ridiculous, if we should deny the Moon to be Earth, because it is not seated in the lowest Region of the World, and yet affirm it to be a Star, thÃ´ so many Millions of Miles remote from the Firmament or <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Mobile,</hi> as if it were plung'd into some deep Gulf: for she is so low before all other Stars, that the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Distances cannot be express'd, and You, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, want Numbers to compute and reckon it; but she in a manner touches the Earth, making her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution so neer the Tops of the Mountains, that she seems, as <hi>Empedocles</hi> has it, to leave even the very Tracks of her Chariot-Wheel behind her: For oftentimes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46328:96"/> she surpasses not the shadow of the Earth, which is very short thrÃ´ the exceessive Greatness of the Sun, that shines upon it; but seems to turn so near the <hi>Superficies,</hi> and, as one may say, between the Arms, and in the Bosom of the Earth, that it withholds from her the Light of the Sun, because she mounts that shady, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and nocturnal Region, which is the Lot and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Earth. And therefore I am of Opinion, we may boldly say, that the Moon is within the Limits and Confines of the Earth, seeing that she is even darkned by the Summits of its Mountains.</p>
               <p>But leaving the Stars, as well erring as fixt, see, what <hi>Aristarchus</hi> proves and demonstrates in his Treatise <hi>of Magnitudes</hi> and <hi>Distances,</hi> that the Distance of the Sun is above eighteen times, and under twenty times greater than that of the Moon from us. And yet they, who place her lowest, say that her Distance from us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains six and fifty of the Earths Semidiameters, that is, that she is six and fifty times as far from us, as we are from the Center of the Earth: which is forty thousand <hi>Stadia:</hi> and therefore according to those; who make their Computation moderately, the Sun is above four Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and three hundred thousand <hi>Stadia</hi> distant from the Moon: so far is she from the Sun by reason of her Gravity, and so near does she approach to the Earth. So that if Substances are to be distinguisht by Places, the Portion and Region of the Earth challenges to it self the Moon, which by reason of Neighbourhood and Proximity has a Right to be reputed and reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the terrestrial Natures and Bodies. Nor shall we, in my Opinion, do amiss, if having given to these Bodies, which are said to be above, so vast an Interval and Distance; we leave also to those which are below, some Space and Room to turn them in, such as is that between the Earth and the Moon.

Besides this, see, whether they are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of a great Inconvenience and Error: for if 'tis true, that all, which is wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46328:97"/> Point, which has no Body, which will of necessity make head against, and oppose all the rest of the Worlds Nature, if <hi>Above</hi> and <hi>Beneath, High</hi> and <hi>Low,</hi> are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally opposite to one another. Nor is this the only Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity, will that will follow, but all heavy and ponderous Bodies also lose the Cause, for which they move and tend downwards hither, for there will be no Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to which they should move; and as for that which is incorporeal, 'tis not probable, neither will they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves allow it to be so forcible, as to draw and retain all things about it self. But if it is unreasonable, and contrary to Nature, that the whole World should be Above, and that there should be nothing Below, but an incorporeal and indivisible Term or Limit, then is this, as we say, yet more reasonable, that the Region above, and that below, being divided the one from the other, have nevertheless each of them a large and spacious Room.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, supposing, if you please, that 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Nature, for earthly Bodies to have any Motions in Heaven; let us consider leisurely and mildly, and not violently, as is done in Tragedies, that this is no Proof of the Moons not being Earth, but only that Earth is in a Place, where by Nature it should not be: for the Fire of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> is indeed against Nature under Ground, nevertheless it ceases not to be Fire. And the Wind, contain'd within Bottles, is indeed of its own Nature light, and inclin'd to ascend, but is yet by force constrain'd to be there, where naturally it should not be. And is not our very Soul, I beseech you in the Name of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which as you your Selves say, is light, of a fiery Substance, and imperceptible to Sense, included within the Body, which is heavy, cold, and palpable? Yet we do not therefore say, that the Soul is nothing within the Body; or that it is not a Divine Substance under a gross and heavy Mass, or that it does
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46328:97"/> not in a moment pass thrÃ´ Heaven, Earth, and Sea, pierce into the Flesh, Nerves, and Marrow, and is with the Humors the Cause of a thousand Passions. And even your <hi>Jupiter,</hi> such as you imagin him, and depaint him to be, is he not of his own Nature a great and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Fire? Yet now he submits, is pliable, and transform'd into all things by several Mutations. Take heed therefore, good Sir, lest by transferring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing every thing to the Place, assign'd it by Nature, you so philosophize, as to bring in a Dissolution of the whole World, and put all things again into that State of Enmity, mention'd by <hi>Empedocles,</hi> or, to speak more properly, lest you raise up again those ancient <hi>Titans</hi> and Giants, to put on Arms against Nature, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to introduce again that fabulous Disorder and Confusion, where all, that is heavy, goes one way apart, and all, that is light, another;

For if there had not been any other part of the World against Nature, but every thing had been in the same Place and Quality, it naturally ought to be, without standing in need of any Change or Transposition, or having had any Occasion for it from the Beginning: I know not, what the Work of Divine Providence is, or in what it consists, or of what <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> has been the Father, Creator, or Worker. For there would not in a Camp be any need of a Man, who is well skill'd in the Art of ranging and ordering of Battles, if every Souldier of himself knew and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood his Rank, Place, and Station, and the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he ought to take and keep; nor would there be any want of Gardiners or Builders, if Water were of it self fram'd to flow, where it is necessary, and irrigate such Plants, as stand in need of watering; or if Bricks, Timber, and Stones would of their own Inclinations and Natural Motions range and settle themselves in due and fitting Places and Orders. Now if this Discourse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly takes away Providence, and if the Ordering and Distinction of things, that are in the World, belongs to God, why should we wonder at Natures having been so dispos'd and ordain'd by him, that the Fire should be here, and the Stars there, and again the Earth should be situated here below, and the Moon above, lodg'd in a more sure and strait Prison, found out by Reason, than that, which was first ordain'd by Nature? For if it were of absolute Necessity, that all things should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their natural Instinct, and move according to the Motion, given them by Nature, neither the Sun, <hi>Venus,</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:46328:98"/> nor any other Planet, would any more run a circular Course: for light and fiery Substances have by Nature their Motion directly upwards. And if perhaps Nature it self receive this Permutation and Change by reason of the Place, that Fire, having its Motion here, should in a direct Line tend upwards, but being once arriv'd at Heaven, should turn round with the Revolution of the Heavens, what wonder would it be, if heavy and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Bodies, being in like manner out of their natural Place, are vanquisht by the ambient Air, and forc'd to take another sort of Motion. For it cannot with any Reason be said, that Heaven has by Nature the Power to take away from light things the Property of mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly upwards, and cannot likewise have the Force to overcome heavy things, and such as tend downwards; but that sometimes making use of this Power, and sometimes of the proper Nature of the things, it still orders every thing for the best.</p>
               <p>But if laying aside those ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ile Habits and Opinions, to which we have enslav'd our selves, we must frankly and fearlesly deliver our Judgment, it seems clear to me, that there is not any part of the Universe, which has a peculiar and separate Rank, Situation, or Motion, that can simply be said to be natural to it. But when every thing exhibits and yields up it self to be mov'd, as is most profitable and fit for that, for whose Sake it was made, and to which it is by Nature appointed, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, doing, or being dispos'd, as is most expedient and meet for the Safety, Beauty, and Power of the same, than it appears to have its Place, Motion and Disposition according to Nature. As a Proof of this, we may observe, that Man, who, if any thing in the World be so, is made and dispos'd according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, has upwards, especially about his Head, heavy and terrestrial things, and about the Middle of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy such, as are hot, and participate of Fire; of his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46328:99"/> Teeth also some grow upwards, and some downwards, and yet neither the one nor the other are contrary to Nature; neither is the Fire, which shines in his Eyes, according to Nature, and that, which is in his Heart and Stomach against it; but it is in each place proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and beneficially seated. Moreover, consider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all Shell-fishes, and, that I may use the Words of <hi>Empedocles,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Look on the Crabs, the Oisters of the Sea,</l>
                     <l>And Shell-fish all, which heavy Coats enfold,</l>
                     <l>The Tortoise too with arched Back, whom we</l>
                     <l>Cover'd with Crust, as hard as Stone, behold:</l>

                     <l>They hardned Earth above their Bodies bear.</l>
                  </q> And yet this Crust, stone-like, hard, and heavy, as it is, thus plac'd over their Bodies, does not press and crush the Moisture, inclos'd within them, nor on the contrary does their natural Heat fly upwards by reason of its Lightness, and vanish away, but they are mingled and compos'd one with another, according to the Nature of every one.</p>
               <p>Wherefore 'tis also probable, that the World, if it is an Animal, has in many parts of its Body Earth, and in as many Fire and Water, not thrust and driven into it by Force, but order'd and dispos'd by Reason: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Eye by its Lightness forc'd into that part of the Body, where it is, nor the Heart by its Gravity press'd down into the Breast; but both the one and the other were thus plac'd, because it was better and more expedient. In like manner we ought not to think, that of the Parts of the World either the Earth setled, where it is, being beaten down thither by its Ponderosity, or the Sun carry'd upwards by its Levity, like a Bottle or Bladder full of Wind, which, being plung'd into the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46328:99"/> Bottom of the Water, immediately rises up again, as <hi>Metrodorus</hi> of <hi>Chios</hi> was perswaded, or that the other Stars, as if they had been put into a Ballance, were sway'd this way or that way, according to their Weight or Lightness, and so mounted higher or lower to the Places, they now possess. But Reason having prevail'd in the Constitution of the World, the Stars have, like to glittering Eyes, been fixt in the Firmament, as it were in the Face of the Universe, there to turn conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually about; and the Sun, having the Force and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the Heart, sends and distributes its Heat and Light, like Blood and Spirits, throughout all: the Earth and Sea are in the World, as the Paunch and Bladder in the Body of a living Creature: And the Moon plac'd between the Sun and the Earth, as the Liver, or some other soft Entral between the Heart and the Belly, transmits down thither the Heat of the Superior Bodies, and draws round about her the Vapors, which arise from hence, subtilizing them by way of Concoction and Purification. And whether its solid and terrestrial Quality has any other Property, serving for some profitable Use, is indeed unknown to us; but 'tis however securest and best, in all things to hold, what is necessary: for what Probability can we draw from that, which they affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They say, that the most subtile and luminous Part of the Air, by reason of its Rarity, became Heaven; but what was thickned and closely driven together, was made into Stars, of which the Moon being the heaviest, is compacted of the grossest and muddiest Matter. And yet 'tis plainly to be seen, that the Moon is not separated or divided from the Air; but moves and makes her Revolution thrÃ´ that, which is about her, to wit, the Region of the Winds, and where the Comets are engendred, and keep their Course. These Bodies then were not by a natural Inclination thus plac'd and situated as they are,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46328:100"/> but have by some other Reason been so order'd and dispos'd.</p>
               <p>These things being said, as I was giving <hi>Lucius</hi> his Turn to follow and continue the Discourse, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing left to be added, but the Demonstrations of this Doctrine, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> smiling, said: I am a Witness, that you have directed all your Contradictions, and all your Refutations against those, who, supposing the Moon to be half Fire, affirm in general, that all Bodies do of their own accord tend either upwards or downwards; but if there is any one, who holds, that the Stars have of their own Nature a circular Motion, and that they are of a Substance wholly different from the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you have not thought of saying any thing, so much as accidentally, or by the way, against him: and therefore I am wholly unconcern'd in your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>Indeed, good Sir, said <hi>Lucius,</hi> if you should suppose the other Stars, and the whole Heaven apart, to be of a pure and sincere Nature, free from all Change and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Passion, and should bring in also a Circle, in which they make their Motion by a perpetual Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you would not perhaps find any one now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict you, thÃ´ there are in this infinite Doubts and Difficulties.

But to let pass all other Inequalities and Differences, the very Face, which appears in the Body of the Moon, necessarily proceeds from some Passion of her own Substance, or the Mixture of another: for what is mixt, suffers, because it loses its first Purity, being fill'd by force with that which is worse. Besides, as for
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46328:100"/> the Slowness and Dullness of her Course, her feeble and inefficacious Heat, by which, as <hi>Ion</hi> says,
<q>The black Grape comes not to maturity,</q> to what shall we attribute them but to her Weakness and Passion, if an eternal and celestial Body can be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Passion?</p>
               <p>In brief, my Friend <hi>Aristotle,</hi> if the Moon is Earth, she is a most fair and admirable thing, and excellently well adorn'd, but if you regard her as a Star, or Light, or a certain divine and heavenly Body, I am afraid, she will prove deform'd and foul, and disgrace that beautiful Appellation, if of all those Bodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, which are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so numerous, she alone stands in need of Light, borrow'd of another, and, as <hi>Parmenides</hi> has it,
<q>Looks always backwards on the Suns bright Rays.</q> Our Friend therefore indeed, having in a Lecture of his, demonstrated this Proposition of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that the Sun communicates to the Moon, what Brightness she has, was well esteem'd for it. As for me, I will not say, what I have learnt of you, or with you, but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken it for granted, will pass on to the rest. 'Tis then probable, that the Moon is illuminated, not like a Glass or Cristal, by the Brightness of the Suns Rays, shining thrÃ´ her; nor yet again, by a certain Collustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conjunction of Light and Brightness, as when many Torches, set together, augment the Light of one another. For so she would be no less full in her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, or first Quarter, than in her Opposition, if she did not obstruct or repel the Rays of the Sun, but let them pass thrÃ´ her by reason of her Rarity; or if he did by a Contemperature shine upon her, and kindle the Light within her. For we cannot alledge her Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46328:101"/> and Aversions in the Conjunction or new Moon, as when it is half Moon, or when she appears tipt, cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or in the Wane; but being then perpendicularly, as <hi>Democritus</hi> says, under him, that illuminates her, she receives and admits the Sun: so that then 'tis probable, she should appear, and he shine thrÃ´ her. But this she is so far from doing, that she is not only then unseen, but also often hides the Sun, as <hi>Empedocles</hi> has it:
<q>
                     <l>The Suns bright Beams from us she turns aside,</l>
                     <l>And of the Earth it self as much doth hide,</l>
                     <l>As her Orbs breadth can cover:â€”</l>
                  </q> As if the Light of the Sun fell not upon another Star, but upon Night and Darkness. And as for what <hi>Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> says, that the Depth of the Moons Body is the Cause, why the Light of the Sun cannot pierce thrÃ´ her to us, this is evidently refuted: for the Air, which is infinite, and of a far greater Depth than the Body of the Moon, is nevertheless all over illustrated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the Rays of the Sun. It remains then, that, according to the Opinion of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> the Light of the Moon, which appears to us, comes from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percussion and Reflexion of the Suns Beams. And for this reason it comes not to us hot and bright, as in all probability it would, if her Shining proceeded either from Inflammation, or the Commixtion of two Lights. But as Voices, reverberated, cause an <hi>Echo,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounding more obscure, and less express than the Speech, that was pronounc'd, and as the Blows of Darts and Arrows, rebounding from some Wall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which they were shot, are more mild and gentle:

               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> then, taking up the Discourse, said, There is indeed a great deal of probability in all that you have spoken: But as to the strongest Objection, that is brought against it, has it, think you, been any way weakned by this Discourse? Or has our Friend quite pass'd it over in Silence?</p>
               <p>What Opposition do you mean, said <hi>Lucius?</hi> Is it the Difficulty about the Moon, when one half of her appears enlightned?</p>
               <p>The very same, answer'd <hi>Sylla:</hi> For there is some Reason, seeing that all Reflexion is made by equal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, that, when the Half-Moon is in the midst of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Light, proceeding from her, should not be carry'd upon the Earth, but glance, and fall beyond and on one side of it. For the Sun, being plac'd in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, touches the Moon with his Beams, which, being equally refracted, will therefore necessarily fall on the other Bound of the Horizon, and not send their Light down hither; or else there will be a great Distortion and Difference of the Angle: which is impossible.</p>
               <p>And yet by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> reply'd <hi>Lucius,</hi> this has not been forgotten, or overpass'd, but already spoken to. And casting his Eye, as he was discoursing upon the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician <hi>Menelaus,</hi> I am asham'd, said he, in your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, dear <hi>Menelaus,</hi> to attempt the subverting and overthrowing of a Mathematical Position, which is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, as a Basis and Foundation to the Doctrine of the <hi>Catoptricks</hi> concerning the Causes and Reasons of Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. And yet of necessity I must: for it neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46328:102"/> of it self, nor is confess'd as true, that all Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tend to equal Angles; but this Position is first check'd and contradicted in emboss'd and convex Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, when they represent the Images of things, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at one Point of the Sight, greater than the things themselves. And it is also disprov'd by double Mirrors, which being inclin'd or turn'd one towards the other, the Angle is made within, and each of the Glasses or plain Superficies yields a double Resemblance: so that there are four Images from the same Face, two answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Parts without on the left side, and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers obscure, and not so evident on the right side in the Bottom of the Mirror, where they yield Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, appearing greater than themselves, at one only Point of the Sight. The same also is overthrown by those Mirrors, that are concave or hollow, wherein the Aspect is variable, of which <hi>Plato</hi> renders the efficient Cause: for he says, that, a Mirror being rais'd on the one and other side, the Sight varies the Reflection, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the one side to the other. And therefore, since of the Views or Visions, some immediately have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to us, and others, sliding on the opposite part of the Mirror, do again return upon us from thence, 'tis not possible, that all Reflexions should be made at equal Angles: thÃ´ those, who closely impugn our Opinion, contend, that by these Defluxions of Light from the Moon upon the Earth the Equality of Angles is taken away, thinking this to be much more probable than the other.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, if we must of necessity yield and grant thus much to our dearly beloved Geometry, first, this should in all likelihood befall those Mirrors, which are perfectly smooth, and exquisitley polisht; whereas the Moon has many Inequalities and Roughnesses, so that the Rays, proceeding from a vast Body, and carry'd to mighty Altitudes, receive one from another, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercommunicate
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46328:102"/> their Lights, which, being sent to and fro, and reciprocally distributed, are refracted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlac'd all manner of ways, and the Counter-Lights meet one another, as if they came to us from several Mirrors. And then, thÃ´ we should suppose these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions on the Superficies of the Moon to be made at equal Angles, yet 'tis not impossible, that the Rays, coming down unto us by so long an Interval, may have their Flexions, Fractions, and Delapsions, that the Light, being compounded, may shine the more. Some also there are, who prove by lineary Demonstration, that she sends much of her Light down to the Earth by a direct Line, drawn plumb under her, as she enclines. But to make the Description and Delineation of it thus publickly, especially, where there were so many Auditors, was not very easie. But in brief, said he, I wonder, how they come thus to alledge against us the Half Moon, there being the same Reason, when she is on both sides emboss'd, and crescent. For if the Sun en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned the Moon, as a Mass of etherial or fiery Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he would never surely leave one Hemisphere, or half of her Globe, always appearing dark and shadowy to Sence, as it is seen to be; but how little soever he toucht her Superficies, it would be agreeable to Reason, that she should be wholly replenisht, and totally chang'd by that Light of his, which by reason of its Agility and Swiftness so easily spreads and passes thrÃ´ all. For, since Wine, touching Water only in one Point, or one Drop of Blood, falling into any Liquor, dies and colours it all with a red or purple Colour; and since they say, that the very Air is alter'd and chang'd with Light, not by any Defluxions or Beams intermingled, but by a sudden Conversion and Change, made in one only Point; how can they imagine, that one Star, touching another Star, and one Light another Light, should not be immediately mingled, nor make any thorow Confusion or Change;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46328:103"/> but only exteriorly illuminate that, whose Superficies it touches. For that Circle, which the Sun makes by fetching a Compass, and turning towards the Moon, sometimes falling upon the very Line, that distinguishes her visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Part from her invisible, and sometimes rising up directly, so that it cuts her in two, and is reciprocally cut by her, causing in her by several Inclinations and Habitudes of the Luminous to the Dark those various Forms, by which she appears but Half, Emboss'd on both sides, Horned, and Crescent: that, more than any thing else, demonstrates, that all this Illumination of the Moon is not a Mixture, but only a Touching; nor a Conflux or Gathering together of sundry Lights, but only an Illustration round about.</p>
               <p>But forasmuch as she is not only enlightned her self, but also sends back hither the Image of her Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this confirms us yet farther, in what we say touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Substance. For Reflexions and Reverberations are not made upon any thing, which is rare, and of thin and subtil Parts, nor is it easily to be imagin'd, how Light can rebound from Light, or one Fire from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but that, which is to make the Reverberation or Reflexion, must be solid and firm, that a Blow may be given against it, and a Rebounding made from it. As a Proof of this, we see, that the Air transmits the Sun, and gives him way to pierce quite thrÃ´ it, not obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or driving back his Rays; but on the contrary from Wood, Stones, or Clothes, put in the Sun, there are made many Reflexions of Light, and many Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons round about. So we see that the Earth is illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, not to the very Bottom, as the Water, nor throughly and all over, as the Air, thrÃ´ which the Beams of the Sun have a clear Passage; but just such a Circle, as he makes in turning about the Moon, and as much as he cuts off from her, with such another does he compass the Earth, and so much does he enlighten,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46328:103"/> the rest being left without Light: for what is illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both in the one and in the other, is little more than an Hemisphere. Permit me therefore now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude after the manner of Geometricians by Proportion. If there are three things, which the Light of the Sun approaches, the Air, the Moon, and the Earth, and if we see, that the Moon is enlightned by him, not as the Air, but as the Earth, 'tis of necessity, that those two things must have one and the same Nature, which of one and the same Cause suffer the same Effects.</p>
               <p>Now when all the Company began highly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Harangue, This is excellently well done of you, <hi>Lucius,</hi> (said I do him,) that you have to so fine a Discourse added as fine a Proportion: for you must not be defrauded of that, which is your Due.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Lucius,</hi> smiling, thus went on: I have yet a second Proportion to be added to the former, by which we will clearly demonstrate, that the Moon altogether resembles the Earth, not only because they suffer and receive the same Accidents from the same Cause, but because they work the same Effects on the same Object.

Now both of these are Obscurations: but that of his Setting is from the Earth, and that of his being eclips'd from the Moon, their Shadows intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Sight. Now the Consequences of these things are easily understood. For if the Effect is alike, the efficient Causes are also alike: because it is of necessity, that the same Effects, hapning in the same Subjects, proceed from the same Efficients. Now if the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Eclipses is not so profound, nor does so forcibly and entirely seize the Air, as does the Night, we are not to wonder at it: for the Substance of the Body, which makes the Night, and of that which causes the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46328:104"/> Eclipse, is indeed the same, thÃ´ their Greatness is not equal. For the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> if I am not mistaken, hold, that the Moon is in Bigness the two and seventieth Part of the Earth; and <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> says, she is as big as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponnesus;</hi> and <hi>Aristarchus</hi> shews the overthwart Line or Diameter of the Moon to have a Proportion to that of the Earth, which is less, than if sixty were compar'd to nineteen, and somewhat greater, than an hundred and eight compar'd to forty and three. Whence it happens, that the Earth, by reason of its Greatness, wholly withdraws the Sun from our Sight: for 'tis a great Obstacle and Opposition, and lasts all the Night. But the Moon, althÃ´ she sometimes hides all the Sun, yet that Eclipse continues not so long, nor is so far extended, but there always appears about the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference a certain Brightness, which permits not the Darkness to be black, deep, and perfectly obscure.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Aristotle,</hi> I mean the ancient Philosopher of that Name, rendring the Reason, why there are oftner seen to happen Eclipses of the Moon, than of the Sun, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other Causes alledges this, that the Sun is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips'd by the Interposition of the Moon, and the Moon by that of the Earth, which is much greater, and more spacious, and consequently oftner opposes it self. And <hi>Posidonius</hi> thus defines this Accident: The Eclipse of the Sun is the Conjunction of the Sun and Moon, the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of which darkens our Sight. For there is no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse, but only to those, whose Sight the Shadow of the Moon intercepting, hinders them from seeing the Sun. Now in confessing, that the Shadow of the Moon descends down to us, I know not what he has left himself to say. 'Tis certainly impossible for a Star to cast a Shadow: for tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>, which is not enlightned, is call'd a Shadow, and Light makes no Shadow, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary drives it away. But what Arguments, said he, were alledg'd after this?</p>
               <p>The Moon, answer'd I then, suffer'd the same Eclipse.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:46328:105"/>
               <p>You have done well, reply'd he, to put me in mind of it. But would you have me go on, and prosecute the rest of the Discourse, as if you had already sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and granted, that the Moon is eclips'd, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted within the Shadow of the Earth? or shall I take for the Subject of a Declamation the making a Demonstration of it by rehearsing to you all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, one after another?</p>
               <p>Nay by <hi>Jove,</hi> said <hi>Theon,</hi> let this be the Argument of your discourse. For I indeed stand in need of some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, having only heard, that, when these three Bodies, the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are in a direct Line, then Eclipses happen: for that either the Earth takes the Sun from the Moon, or the Moon take him from the Earth. For the Sun then suffers an Eclipse or Defect, when the Moon, and the Moon, when the Earth is in the midst of three: of which the one happens in the Conjunction, or New Moon, and the other in the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, or when the Moon is full.</p>
               <p>Then said <hi>Lucius:</hi> These are the principal Points, and the Summary of what is said. But in the first place, if you please, take the Argument, drawn from the Form and Figure of the Shadow, which is that of a <hi>Cone</hi> or <hi>Pyramid,</hi> with the sharp end forward, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when a great Fire or Light, that is round, or sphaerical, encompasses a Mass, that is also globular, but less: whence it comes, that in the Eclipses of the Moon the Circumscriptions of the Black and Dark from the Clear and Luminous have their Sections al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways round. For the Approaches of a round Body, which way soever it goes, whether it gives or receives Sections, do by reason of the Similitude always keep a circular Form. Now as for the second Argument, I suppose, you understand, that the first Part, which is eclips'd in the Moon, is always that, which looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ds the East; and in the Sun that, which regards
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46328:105"/> the West: now the Shadow of the Earth moves from the East to the West; but the Sun and Moon from the West Eastward. The Experience of the Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences gives us a visible Knowledge of this, nor is there need of many Words to make us fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, and from these Suppositions the Cause of the Eclipse is confirm'd. For, inasmuch as the Sun is eclips'd by being overtaken, and the Moon by meeting that, which makes the Eclipse, it probably, or rather necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows, that the one is surpriz'd behind, and the other before. For the Obstruction begins on that side, whence that, which causes it, first approaches: Now the Moon comes upon the Sun from the West, as striving in course with him, and hastning after him; but the Shadow of the Earth comes from the East, as that, which has a contrary Motion. The third Argument is taken from the Time and Greatness of the Eclipses. For the Moon, if she is eclips'd, when she is on high in her <hi>ApogÃ«on,</hi> or at her farthest distance from the Earth, continues but a little in her Defect or Want of Light; But when she suffers the same Accident, being low, and in her <hi>ProsgÃ«on</hi> or near the Earth, she is very much oppress'd, and slowly gets out of the Shadow: and yet, when she is low, she moves swifter, and when high, slower. But the Cause of the Difference is in the Shadow, which is, like <hi>Pyramids,</hi> broadest at the Bottom or <hi>Basis,</hi> and, growing still narrower by little and little, terminates in a sharp point at the Top. Whence it comes, that, when she is low, she is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrass'd within greater Circles, traversing the Bottom of the Shadow, and what is most obscure and dark; but when she is high, being thrÃ´ the Narrowness of the Shadow, as it were but in a shallow Puddle, by which she is but little sully'd, she immediately gets out again. I omit the Effects, which have particular Causes. For we see, that Fire shines forth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46328:106"/> brighter out of a dark and shady Place, thrÃ´ the thickness of the caliginous Air, which admits no Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions or Diffusions of the Fires Vertue, but keeps in and contains its Substance within it self: or rather, if this is a Passion of the Sense, as hot things, when neer to cold ones, are felt to be hotter, and Pleasures immediately after Pains are found more vehement: so things, that are bright, appear better, when they are neer to such, as are obscure, by means of different Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which more strain and extend the Imagination. But there seems to be a greater Appearance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in the first Reason: For in the Sun all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fire not only loses its Faculty of illuminating, but is also rendred duller and more unapt to burn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Heat of the Sun dissipates and scatters all its Force.</p>
               <p>If it were then true, that the Moon, being, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> say, a muddy and troubled Star, has a weak and duskish Fire, it would be meet, that she should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer none of these Accidents, which she is now seen to suffer, but altogether the contrary: to wit, that she should be seen, when she is hidden; and absconded, when she appears: that is, she should be conceal'd all the rest of the time, being obscur'd by the environing Air, and again shine forth, and become apparent and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest for six Months together, and afterwards disappear again five Months, entring into the Shadow of the Earth. For of four hundred sixty and five Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Lunary Eclipses, four hundred and four are of six Months to six, and the rest of five to five. The Moon then should all this time appear shining in the Shadow; but on the contrary we see, that in the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow she is eclips'd and loses her Light, and recovers it again, after she is escap'd and got forth of the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Nay she appears often in the day time, so that she is rather any thing else, then a fiery and starry Body.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:46328:106"/>
               <p>These things assoon as <hi>Lucius</hi> had said, <hi>Pharnaces</hi> and <hi>Apollonides</hi> ran both together upon him, to oppugn and refute his Discourse: and then <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> assisted by <hi>Apollonides,</hi> who was present, and gave him way, said: This it is, that principally shews the Moon to be a Star, and of a fiery Nature, that in her Eclipses she is not wholly obscur'd, and disappearing; but shews her self with a certain Coal-resembling Color, terrible to the sight, yet such as is proper to her.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Apollonides,</hi> he insisted much in opposition to the Word <hi>Shadow,</hi> saying, that the Mathematicians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways give that Name to the Place, which is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and that Heaven admits no Shadow.</p>
               <p>To this I thus answer'd: This Instance is rather alledg'd obstinately against the Name, than naturally or mathematically against the Thing: for if one will not call the Place, obfuscated by the Opposition of the Earth a Shadow, but a Place depriv'd of Light, yet, be it what it will, you must of necessity confess, that the Moon, being there, becomes obscure: and every way, said I, 'tis a Folly to deny, that the Shadow of the Earth reaches thither, from whence the Shadow of the Moon, falling upon our Sight here on Earth, causes the Eclipse of the Sun. And therefore I now address my self to you, <hi>Pharnaces:</hi> For this coal-like and burnt Color of the Moon, which you affirm to be proper to her, belongs to a Body, that has Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Depth: For there is not wont to remain any Relick, Mark, or Print of Flame in a Body, that is rare; nor can a Coal be made, where there is not a solid Body, which may receive into it the Heat of the Fire, as <hi>Homer</hi> himself shews in a certain Passage, where he says:
<q>
                     <l>When the Fires Flow'r was vanisht, and quite dead</l>
                     <l>Its Flame, then the left Coals abroad he spread.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:46328:107"/> For the Coal seems not properly a Fire, but a Body enkindled and alter'd by the Fire, staying and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a solid Mass, and which has, as it were, taken Root; whereas Flames are the setting on Fire and Fluxions of a Nutriment and Matter, which is of a rare Substance, and by reason of its Weakness makes no long Resistance, but is quickly resolv'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd: so that there could not be any more evident and plain Argument, to demonstrate, that the Moon is solid and earthly, than if her proper Color were that of a Coal. But it is not so, my Friend <hi>Pharnaces;</hi> but in her Eclipses she diversly changes her Colors, which the Mathematicians, determining with respect to the Time and Hour, thus distinguish. If she is eclips'd in the Evening, she appears horribly black for above three hours and an half; if about Midnight, she sends forth this reddish and Fire-resembling Color, and after seven hours and an half there arises a Redness indeed; and finally if about the Dawning of the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Sun-rise, she takes a blew or grayish Color: which is the Cause, why she is by the Poets, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by <hi>Empedocles,</hi> call'd <hi>GlaucÃ´pis,</hi> or Gray-ey'd. Since then they clearly see, that the Moon changes into so many Colors in the Shadow, they do ill to attribute to her only that of a burning Coal, which may be said to be less proper to her, than any other, being only a small Remnant and Semblance of Light, appearing and shining thrÃ´ a Shadow, her own proper Color being black and earthy. And since that here below, the Rivers and Lakes, which receive the Rays of the Sun, seeming to take on their Superficies sometimes a red Color, sometimes a violet one, the neighboring shady Places take the same Appearances of Colors, and are illuminated by them, casting and sending back by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Reflexions several rebated Splendors: what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, if a copious Flux of a Shadow, falling, like
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:46328:107"/> a great River, on an immense celestial Sea of a Light, not steady and quiet, but agitated by innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Stars, walking over it, and besides admitting several Mixtures and Mutations in it self, takes from the Moon the Impression, sometimes of one Color, sometimes of another, and sends them hither to us? For 'tis not to be deny'd, but that a Star or Fire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not appear in a Shadow black, gray, or violet; but there are seen upon Hills, Plains, and Seas, several various Resemblances of Colors, caus'd by the Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sun, which are the very Tinctures, that Brightness, mixt with Shadows and Mists, as if it were with Painters Colors, brings upon them. And as for the Tinctures or Colors of the Sea, <hi>Homer</hi> has indeed in some sort endeavour'd to name and express them, when he sometimes terms the Sea violet-color'd, or red as Wine, at other times the Waves purple, and again the Sea azure, and the Calm white. As for the Diversities of Tinctures and Colors, appearing upon the Earth, he has, I suppose, omitted them, because they are in number infinite. Now it is not probable, that the Moon has but one Superficies all plain and even, as the Sea; but rather that of its Nature it principally resembles the Earth, of which old <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> seem'd to mythologize at his Pleasure, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were, that under covert and aenigmatical Speeches he meant it of the Moon, or whether he spake of some other. For 'tis neither incredible, nor wonderful, if the Moon, having in her self nothing corrupt or muddy, but enjoying a pure and clear Light from Heaven, and being full of Heat, not of a burning and furious Fire, but of such, as is mild and harmless, has in her Places, admirably fair and pleasant, resplendent Mountains, clear as Fire, purple-color'd Cinctures or Zones, store of Gold and Silver, not dispers'd here and there within her Bowels, but
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46328:108"/> flourishing in great Abundance on the Superficies of her Plains, or spread all over her smooth Hills and Mountains.</p>
               <p>And if the Sight of all these things comes to us thrÃ´ a Shadow, sometimes in one manner, and sometimes in another, by reason of the Diversity and different Change of the ambient Air, the Moon does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lose the venerable Perswasion, that is had of her, or the Reputation of Divinity: being esteem'd by Men an heavenly Earth, or rather, as the Stoicks say, a troubled, thick, and dreggish Fire. For even the Fire it self is honor'd with <hi>Barbarian</hi> Honor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But the very Name of the Earth is truly dear and venerable to every <hi>Greek,</hi> and there is thrÃ´ all <hi>Greece</hi> a Custom receiv'd of adoring and revering it, as much as any other of the Gods. And we are very far from thinking, that the Moon, which we hold to be an heavenly Earth, is a Body without Soul and Spirit, exempt and depriv'd of all, that is to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to the Gods. For both by Law we yield her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences and Thanksgivings, for what we receive of her, and by Nature we adore, what we acknowledge to be of a more excellent Vertue, and a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Power, and therefore we do not think, that we offend, in supposing the Moon to be Earth.</p>
               <p>Now as to the Face, which appears in her, As this Earth, on which we are, has in it many great Sinuosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Valleys: so 'tis probable, that the Moon also lies open and is cleft with many deep Caves and Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in which there is Water, or very obscure Air, to the Bottom of which the Sun cannot reach or pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, but failing there, sends back a dissipated Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion to us here below.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:46328:108"/>
               <p>Here <hi>Apollonides,</hi> taking up the Discourse, said: Tell me then, I beseech you, good Sir, even by the Moon her self, do you think it possible, that there should be there Shadows of Caves and Chinks, and that the sight of them should come even to our Eyes? Or do you not regard, what will come of it? I will tell you, what it is, and hearken to me, althÃ´ you are not ignorant of it. The Diameter of the Moon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Bigness, which appears to us, when she is in her mean and ordinary Distances, is twelve Digits, and every one of these black and shady Spots is above half a Digit, that is, above the four and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part of the Diameter. Now if we suppose the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Moon to be only thirty thousand <hi>Stadia,</hi> and the Diameter, according to that Supposition, to be ten thousand, every one of these shadowy Marks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her will not be less than five hundred <hi>Stadia.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider then first, whether there can possibly be in the Moon such great Gaps, and such Inequalities, as may make such a Shadow; and then how it is possible, that being so great, they are not seen by us.</p>
               <p>At this I, smiling upon him, said: You have done me a Pleasure, dear <hi>Apollonides,</hi> in having found out such a Demonstration, by which you will prove, that you and I shall be bigger than those Giants<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>For the Shadow of that Mountain falls, as it seems, on the Image of a brazen Heifer, which is in <hi>Lemnos,</hi> extending it self in length over the Sea not less than seven hundred <hi>Stadia:</hi> not that the Mountain, which makes the Shadow, is of that Height, as to cause it; but because the Distance of the Light renders the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Bodies manifoldly greater than the Bodies themselves. Consider then here, that, when the Moon is in the Full, and shews us the Form of a Visage most expresly by reason of the Profundity of the Shadow, 'tis then, that she is most remote from the Sun: for 'tis the Recoiling of the Light, that makes the Shadow bigger, and not the Greatness of the Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities, which are on the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Moon. And you moreover see, that the Brightness of the Suns Beams suffer not the Tops of the Mountains to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

'Tis not therefore any way absurd or strange, if we cannot so exactly see the full Illumination of the Moon, and her Reception of the Suns Beams; but that by the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things, that are obscure and dark, to such, as are clear and shining, they are by reason of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity more exquisitely seen.</p>
               <p>But this, said I, seems rather to refute and check the Reflexion and Reverberation, which is said to rebound from the Moon, because these, who are within the retorted Rays, do not only see that, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, but also that, which enlightens. For when,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46328:109"/> at the Resulting of Light from Water upon a Wall, the Sight shall fall upon the Place, which is thus illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the Reflexion, the Eye there beholds three things, to wit, the Ray or Light, that is driven back, the Water, which makes the Reflexion, and the Sun himself, whose Light, falling on the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Water, is repuls'd and sent back. This being confess'd, as what is evidently seen, 'tis requir'd of those, who say, that the Earth is enlightned from the Moon by the Reflexion of the Suns Rays upon it, that they shew us by Night the Sun, appearing upon the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Moon in the same manner, as he may be seen by day appearing in the Water, on which he shines, when there is the said Reflexions of his Beams. But since the Sun does not so appear, they thence infer, that the Moon receives her Illumination by some other Means, and not by Reflexion, and if there is no Reflexion, the Moon then is not Earth.</p>
               <p>What Answer then is to be made them, said <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonides?</hi> For the Argument of this Objection against Reflexion is common also to us.</p>
               <p>It is indeed, answer'd I, in some sort common, and in some sort not. But first consider the Comparison, how perversly, and against the stream, they take it. For the Water is here below on the Earth, and the Moon there above in Heaven: so that the reflected and reverberated Rays make the form of their Angles quite opposit one to the other, the one having their Point upwards towards the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Moon, and the other downwards towards the Earth. Let them not then require, that every <hi>IdÃ«a</hi> or Form should be equally a Mirror, nor that from every Distance and Remoteness there should be a like and semblable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion: for so doing they would repugn notorious and apparent Evidence. And as for those, who hold the Moon to be a Body, not smooth, even, and subtil,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46328:110"/> as the Water, but solid, massy and terrestrial, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive, why they should require to see the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Sun in her, as in a Glass. For neither does Milk it self render such peculiar Images, nor cause Reflexion of the Sight, by reason of the Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality and Ruggedness of its Parts: How then is it possible, that the Moon should send back the Sight from her <hi>Superficies,</hi> as Mirrors do, that are more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht? And if in these also there is any Scratch, Filth, or Dulness on their <hi>Superficies,</hi> whence the reflected Sight is wont to receive a Form, they indeed may well be seen, but they yield no Counterlight. He then, who requires, that either the Sun should appear in the Moon, or that our Sight should be reverberated and redoubled against the Sun, let him also require, that the Eye be the Sun, the Sight Light, and Man Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For it is probable, that the Reflexion of the Suns Beams, which is made upon the Moon, does by reason of their Vehemence and great Brightness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with a stroke upon us. But our Sight being weak and slender, what wonder is it, if it neither give such a stroke, as may rebound, or, if it rebounds, that it does not maintain its Continuity, but is broken and fails, as not having such abundance of Light, that it should not disgregate and be dissipated within those Inequalities and Asperities. For 'tis not impossible, that the Reflexion of our Sight upon Water, or other sorts of Mirrors, being yet strong, powerful, and neer its Origin, should from thence return upon the Eye. But thÃ´ there may perhaps from the Moon be some Glimmerings, yet they will still be weak and obscure, and will fail in the way by reason of so long a Distance. For otherwise hollow and concave Mirrors send back the reverberated and reflected Rays stronger, than they came, so that they frequently burn, and set on fire; and those, that are convex and imboss'd like a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46328:110"/> Bowl, because they beat them not back on all sides, render them dark and feeble. You see, for certain, when two Rainbows appear together in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, one Cloud comprehending another, that the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, which outwardly environs the other, yields dim Colors, and such, as are not sufficiently distinguisht and express'd, because the exterior Cloud, being more remote, makes not a strong and forcible Reflexion. And what needs there any more to be said, seeing that the very Light of the Sun, reverberated and sent back by the Moon, loses all its Heat; and of his Brightness there comes to us with much ado but a small Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, and that very languishing and weak. Is it then possible, that our Sight, running the same Course, should bring back any Part of the solar Image from the Moon? I for my part think, 'tis not. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, I said, your selves, that, if our Sight were in one and the same manner affected and dispos'd towards the Water, and towards the Moon, the full Moon would of necessity represent to us the Images of the Earth, Trees, Plants, Men, and Stars, as is done by the Water, and all other sorts of Mirrors. And if there is no such Reflexion of our Sight, as to bring us back these Images, either by reason of our said Sights, Weakness, or thrÃ´ the rugged Inequality of the Moons <hi>Superficies,</hi> let us no longer require, that it should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound against the Sun.</p>
               <p>We have then, said I, related, as far as our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory would carry it away, whatever was there said. 'Tis now time to desire <hi>Sylla,</hi> or rather to exact of him, that he would make us his Narration, as being on such Condition admitted to hear all this Discourse. If you think good therefore, let us give over walking, and sitting down on these Seats, make him a quiet and settled Audience.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:46328:111"/>
               <p>Every one approv'd this Motion. And therefore, when we had seated our selves, <hi>Theon</hi> thus began: I am indeed, Ã´ <hi>Lamprias,</hi> as desirous, as any of you can be, to hear, what shall be said: but I would gladly first understand something concerning those, who are said to dwell in the Moon, not, whether there are any persons inhabiting it, but whether 'tis possible, there should be any: for if 'tis not possible for the Moon to be inhabited, 'tis also unreasonable to say, that she is Earth: otherwise she would have been created in vain, and to no End: not bearing any Fruits, nor affording a Place for the Birth or Education of any Men, for which Causes and Ends this Earth, wherein we live, was made and created to be our Nurse and true Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, producing and distinguishing the Day from the Night. Now you know, that of this matter many things have been said, as well merrily and in jest, as seriously and in earnest. For of those, who dwell under the Moon, 'tis said, that she hangs over their Heads, as if they were so many <hi>Tantaluses;</hi> and on the contrary of those, who inhabit her, that being ty'd and bound, like a sort of <hi>Ixions,</hi> they are with so much Violence turn'd and whirl'd about, as if they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in danger of being flung out. Nor is the Moon indeed mov'd by one only Motion, but is, as they are wont to call her <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore 'tis not greatly to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, if thrÃ´ Violence of her Motions there some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time fell a Lion from her into <hi>Peloponnesus;</hi> but 'tis
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46328:111"/> rather to be wondred, that we do not daily see ten thousand Falls of Men and Women, and Shocks of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals tumbling down thence with their Heels upwards on our Heads: for 'twould be a Mockery to dispute about their Habitation there, if they can have there neither Birth nor Existence. For seeing the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> and the <hi>Troglodytes,</hi> over whose Heads the Sun directly stands only one Moment of one day in the Solstice, and then presently retires, can hardly escape being burnt by reason of the Airs excessive Dryness: is it credible, that those, who are in the Moon can bear every year twelve Solstices, the Sun being once a Month just in their Zenith, or exactly over their Head, when the Moon is in Conjunction.

                  </gap>. For, to speak the Truth, they, who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly offended with these things, and wholly discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit them, not being willing mildly to consider, what Probability and Possibility, there may be in them, are not much less in Fault than those, that are too excessive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded of them. First then I say, 'tis not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that the Moon must have been made in vain, and to no End or Purpose, if there are not Men, who dwell in it: for we see, that this very Earth here is not all cultivated, or inhabited; but that only a small Part of it, like so many Promontories, or Demy-Islands, arising out of the Deep, engenders, brings forth, and breeds Plants and Animals: the rest being thrÃ´ exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Cold or Heat wholly desart and barren, or (which is indeed the greatest Share of it) cover'd and plung'd under the vast Ocean. But you, who are always so great a Lover and Admirer of <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> give no Ear to <hi>Crates,</hi> thÃ´ you read
<q>
                     <l>The Sea, which gave to Gods and Men their Birth,</l>
                     <l>Covers with Waves the most part of the Earth.</l>
                  </q> And yet these Parts are far from having been made in vain: for the Sea exhales and breaths out mild Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, and the Snow, leisurely melting from the cold and uninhabited Regions, sends forth, and spreads over all our Countreys those gentle Breezes, which qualify the scorching Heat of Summer, and in the midst, as <hi>Plato</hi> says, is plac'd the faithful Guardian and Operator
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46328:112"/> of Night and Day. There is then nothing to hinder, but that the Moon may be without living Creatures, and yet give Reflexions to the Light, that is diffus'd about her, and afford a Receptacle to the Rays of the Stars, which have their Confluence and Temperature in her, for to digest the Evaporation, rising from the Earth, and moderate the over violent and fiery Heat of the Sun. And attributing much to ancient Fame, and the Opinion, handed down to us by our Ancestors, we will say, that she is stil'd <hi>Diana,</hi> as being a Virgin and fruitless, but otherwise greatly salutary, helpful, and profitable to the World. Moreover of all, that has been laid, my Friend <hi>Theon,</hi> there is nothing, which shews it impossible for the Moon to be inhabited. For her Turning about, being gentle, mild, and calm, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies and polishes the ambient Air, which she in so good order distributes, and spreads about her, that there is no occasion to fear the Falling or Slipping out of those, who live in her, unless She her self also comes tumbling down. And as to the Diversity and Multiplicity of her Motion, it proceeds not from any Inequality, Error, or Uncertainty, but the Astrologers shew in this an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Order and Course, enclosing her within Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which are turn'd by other Circles: some suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, that she her self stirs not, others making her always move equally, smoothly, and with the same Swiftness. For 'tis these Ascensions of divers Circles, with their Turnings and Habitudes, one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with Respect to us, which most exactly make those Heights, Depths, and Depressions, that appear to us in her Motion, and her Digressions in Latitude, all join'd with the ordinary Revolution, she makes in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude. As to the great Heat and continual Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun, you will cease to fear it, if first to the twelve estival Conjunctions you oppose the Full Moons, and then to the Excesses the Continuity of Change,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46328:113"/> which permits them not to last long, reducing them to a proper and peculiar Temperature, and taking from them both what is overmuch: for the Middle, or what is between them, 'tis probable, has a Season, most like to the Spring. And moreover the Sun sends his Beams to us thrÃ´ a gross and troubled Air, and casts on us an Heat, fed by Exhalations, whereas the Air, being there subtil and transparent, dissipates and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perses his Lustre, which has no Nourishment, nor Body, on which it may settle. Trees and Fruits are here nourisht by Showers, but elsewhere, as in the higher Countreys with you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<note n="*" place="margin">He means here the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> not the <hi>Boeotian, Thebes.</hi>

                  <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Syene,</hi> the Earth, drinking in, not aÃ«rial, but earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Water, and being assisted with refreshing Winds and Dew, will not, such is the Vertue and Temperature of the Soil, yield the first place for Fertility to the best-water'd Land in the World. And the same sorts of Trees, which in our Countrey, having been well winter'd, or having suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd a long and sharp Winter, bring forth Abundance of good Fruit, are in <hi>Africk,</hi> and with you in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> soon offended with, and very fearful of Cold. And the Provinces of <hi>Gedrosia</hi> and <hi>Troglodytis,</hi> which ly near the Ocean Sea, being by reason of Drought barren, and without any Trees, there grow nevertheless in the adjacent Sea, Trees of a wonderful Height and Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and green even to the very Bottom: some of which they call Olive-trees, others Laurels, and others the Hairs of <hi>Isis.</hi> And those Plants, which are nam'd <hi>Anacampserotes,</hi> being hang'd up, after they are pluckt out of the ground, they not only live, but, which is more, bud and put forth green Leaves. And of the Seeds, that are sown, some, as namely <hi>Centaury,</hi> if they are sown in a rich and fat Earth, and there well drencht and water'd, degenerate from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46328:113"/> Quality, and lose all their Vertue, because they love Driness, and thrive in their own proper natural Soil. Others cannot bear so much as the least Dew, of which kind are the most part of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Plants, that, if they are but once wet, wither, fade, and dy. What wonder is it then, if there grow in the Moon Roots, Seeds, and Plants, which have no need of Rains, or Winters Colds, and are appropriated to a dry and subtil Air, such as is that of Summer? And why may it not be probable, that the Moon sends forth warm Winds, and that her Shaking and Agitation, as she moves, is accompany'd by comfortable Breezes, fine Dews, and gentle Moistures, which are every where dispers'd to furnish Nutriment for the verdant Plants? seeing She is not of her Temperature ardent, or parch'd with Drought, but rather soft, moist, and ingendring all Humidity. For there comes not from her to us any Effect of Driness, but many of a femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Moisture and Softness, such as are the Growing of Plants, the Putrefaction of Flesh, the Changing and Flatness of Wines, the Tenderness and Rotting of Wood, and the easy Deliveries of child-bearing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But because I am afraid of irritating again and provoking <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> who all this while speaks not a Word, if I should alledge the Flowing and Ebbing of the great Ocean, as they themselves say, with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasings of the Friths and Straits, which swell and rise by the Moon, augmenting the Moisture: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will rather turn my self to you, my Friend <hi>Theon:</hi> for you, interpreting this Verse of the Poet <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Those then, who think the Moon to be a fiery and burning Body, are in an Error: and in like manner those, who would have all such things to be necessary for the Generation, Life, Food, and Entertainment of the Animals, dwelling there, as are requisite to those, that are here below, consider not the vast Diversity and Inequality, there is in Nature, in which there are found greater Varieties and Differences between Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals and Animals, than there are between Animals, and other Subjects, that are not animated. Neither would there be in the World any Men without Mouths, or whose Lips are so grown together, that they feed only on Smells, if it were so, that Men could not live without solid and substantial Food. But that Power of Nature, which <hi>Ammonus</hi> himself has shewn us, and which <hi>Hesiod</hi> has obscurely signify'd in these Words,

                  <hi>Epimenides</hi> has made plain to us in Effect, teaching us, that Nature sustains a living Creature with very little Food, and that, provided it has but the Quantity of an Olive, it stands in need of no other Nourishment. Now, if any, those surely, who dwell within the Moon, should be active, light, and easy to be nourisht with any thing whatsoever: since they affirm, that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46328:114"/> the Moon her self, as also the Sun, which is a fiery Animal, and manifoldly greater than the Earth, is nourisht and maintain'd by the Moistures, that are upon the Earth, as are also all the other Stars, whose Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is in a manner infinit: such light and slender Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals do they assign to the upper Region, and with so small Necessaries do they think them contented and satisfy'd. But we neither see these things, nor consider, that a quite different Region, Nature, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature is accommodated to those Lunar Men.</p>
               <p>As therefore, if we were unable to come near and touch the Sea, but could only see it at a distance, and had heard that its Water is brackish, salt, and undrinkable, any one, who should tell us, that there are in its Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom many and great Animals of various Forms and Shapes, and that it is full of great and monstrous Beasts, making the same use of the Water, as we do of the Air, would be thought only to relate a parcel of strange and uncredible Stories, newly found out and invented for Delight and Amusement: in the same manner we seem to be affected and dispos'd towards the Moon, not believing, that there are any, who inhabit it. And I am of Opinion, that they themselves do much more wonder, when they behold the Earth, which is, as it were, the Dreggs and Mud of the Universe, appearing to them thrÃ´ moist and foggy Clouds and Mists, a little Place, low, abject, and immoveable thing without any Brightness or Light whatever, how this pittiful inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable thing should be able to produce, nourish, and maintain Animals, that have Motion, Respiration and Heat. And if peradventure they had ever heard these Verses of <hi>Homer;</hi>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46328:115"/> into it, and raise there great Bars and Shelves, that choak up the River, and render it hardly naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; whence anciently there arose an Opinion of its being frozen. Moreover the Coasts of this Continenr, lying on the Sea, are inhabited by the <hi>Greeks</hi> about a Bay, not much less than the <hi>Moeotick</hi> Fens, the Mouth of which lies in a direct Line over against that of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. These name and esteem themselves the Inhabitants of the firm Land, calling all us others Islanders, as dwelling in a Land, encompass'd round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and washt by the Sea. And they think, that those, who heretofore came thither, and were left there by him, mixing themselves with the People of <hi>Saturn,</hi> rais'd up again the <hi>Greek</hi> Nation, which was well neer extinguish'd, brought under, and supplanted by the Language, Laws, and Manners of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and made it again flourish, and recover its pristine Vigor. And therefore in that Place they give the first Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the second to <hi>Saturn.</hi> Now when the Star of <hi>Saturn,</hi> by us call'd <hi>Phaenon,</hi> and by them <hi>Nycturus,</hi> comes to the Sign of <hi>Taurus,</hi> as it does once in the Time of thirty years, they, having been a long time preparing, what is necessary for a solemn Sacrifice, and a long Voyage or Navigation, send forth those, on whom the Lot falls, to row in that vast Sea, and make their Abode for a great while in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countreys. These Men then, being embarqu'd, and departed, meet with different Adventures, some in one manner, others in another. Now such as have in safety pass'd the Dangers of the Sea, go first ashore in those opposite Islands, which are inhabited by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> where they see, that the Sun is scarce hidden one full hour during the Space of thirty Days, and that this is their Night, of which the Darkness is but small, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Twy-light from the going down of the Sun, nor unlike the Dawning of the Day: that having continu'd
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46328:116"/> there ninety Days, during which they are highly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress'd and honor'd, as being reputed and term'd holy Men, they are afterwards conducted by the Winds, and transported into the Isle of <hi>Saturn,</hi> where there are no other Inhabitants but themselves, and such as have been sent thither before them. For thÃ´ 'tis lawful for them, after they have serv'd <hi>Saturn</hi> thirty years, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home to their own Countreys and Houses, yet most of them choose rather to remain quietly there: some, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are already accustom'd to the Place; others, because without any Labor and Trouble, they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all things, as well for the offering of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and holding Festival Solemnities, as to support the ordinary Expences of those, who are perpetually conversant in the Study of Learning and Philosophy. For they affirm the Nature of the Island, and the Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Air, which environs it, to be admirable; and that there have been some Persons, who, intending to depart thence, have been hindred by the Divinity or <hi>Genius</hi> of the Place, shewing himself to them, as to his familiar Friends and Acquaintance, not only in Dreams, and exterior Signs, but also visibly appearing to them by the Means of familiar Spirits and Daemons, discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conversing with them. For they say, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> himself is personally there, lying asleep in the deep Cave of an hollow Rock, shining like fine Gold, <hi>Jupiter</hi> having prepar'd Sleep instead of Fetters and Shackles, to keep him from stirring: But that there are on the Top of this Rock certain Birds, which fly down and carry him <hi>Ambrosia:</hi> that the whole Island is fill'd with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Fragrancy and Perfume, which is spread all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, arising from this Cave, as from an odoriferous Fountain: that these Daemons serve and minister to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> having been his Courtiers and nearest Attendants, when he held the Empire and exercis'd Regal Authority over Men and Gods: and that having the Science of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46328:116"/> divining future Occurrences, they of themselves foretel many things; but the greatest, and of the highest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, when they return from assisting <hi>Saturn,</hi> and reveal his Dreams: for whatever <hi>Jupiter</hi> premeditates, <hi>Saturn</hi> dreams; but his Awakenings are <hi>Titanical</hi> Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Perturbations of the Soul in him. His Sleep is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and *** the Royal and divine Nature pure and incontaminate in it self.</p>
               <p>This Stranger then, having been brought thither, and there serving the God in Repose, and at his Ease, attain'd to as great Skill in Astrology, as 'tis possible for any one to do, that has made the greatest Progress in Geometry. As for the rest of Philosophy, having given himself to that, which is call'd <hi>Natural,</hi> he was seiz'd with an extraordinary Desire and Longing to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit and see the great Island: for so they call the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, inhabited by us. After therefore his thirty years were pass'd, and his Successors arriv'd, having taken leave of all his Relations and Friends, he put to Sea, in other respects soberly and moderately equipp'd, but having good store of Voyage-Provision in Vessels of Gold. Now one Day would not suffice to relate unto you in particular, what Adventures befel him, how many Nations he visited, thrÃ´ how many Countreys he pass'd, how he search'd into Sacred Writings, and was initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all holy Confraternities, and Religious Societies, as he himself recounted it to us, exactly particularising every thing. But give ear, I pray you, to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the present Dispute. For he continu'd no small time at <hi>Carthage,</hi> a City, not a little also esteem'd by us, since the Destruction of the former, where he found certain sacred Skins of Parchment, which had been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly convey'd thither, when the old Town was sack'd, and had there long lain hidden under Ground. Now he told me, that of all the Gods, which appear to us in Heaven, we ought chiefly to honour the Moon, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46328:117"/> earnestly exhorted me to be diligent in venerating of her, as having the principal Influence and Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Life.</p>
               <p>At these things when I was amaz'd, and entreated him to declare and explain them a little more fully to me: <hi>The</hi> Greeks, said he, <hi>O</hi> Sylla, <hi>deliver many things concerning the Gods, but they are not always in the Right: for first, when they tell us, that there is a</hi> Ceres, <hi>and a</hi> Proserpine, <hi>they say well; but not so well, when they put them both in one and the same Place: for the one, to wit,</hi> Ceres, <hi>is on the Earth, and the Lady and Mistriss of all earthly things; and the other, to wit,</hi> Proserpine, <hi>in the Moon, and is by those, that inhabit there, call'd</hi> Core <hi>and</hi> Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phone: Persephone, <hi>as being a Bringer of Light and Brightness; and</hi> Core, <hi>because the Apple or Sight of the Eye, in which the Image of him, who looks into it, is represented, as the Brightness of the Sun appears in the Moon, is by the</hi> Greeks <hi>call'd</hi> Core. <hi>And as to what they say concerning the Wandring about of</hi> Ceres <hi>and</hi> Proserpina, <hi>and their mutual seeking of one another, there is in it somewhat of Truth: for they long after each other, being separated, and often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace in Shadow. And that this</hi> Core <hi>is sometimes in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Light, and sometimes in Darkness and Night, is not untrue; only there is some Error in the Computation of the Time: for we see her not six whole Months, but every sixth Month, or from six Months to six Months, caught in the Shadow by the Earth, as by her Mother; and this rarely happens within five Months, because 'tis impossible she should forsake</hi> Pluto, <hi>being his Wife: which</hi> Homer <hi>also covertly, but not unelegantly signify'd, when he said,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Into th'<hi>Elysian</hi> Fields, Earths utmost Bounds,</l>
                     <l>The Gods will bring thee.â€”</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>For he has there plac'd the End and Boundary of the Earth, where the Shadow ceases, and goes no farther. Now into
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46328:117"/> that Place no wicked or impure Person can have Access. But good Folks, being after their Decease carry'd thither, lead there indeed an easie and quiet, but yet not a blessed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life, till the second Death. But what that is, O</hi> Sylla, <hi>ask me not, for I am of my self going to declare it to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The common Opinion, and which most Persons hold, is, that Man is a compound Subject, and this they have reason to believe; but they are mistaken in thinking him to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two Parts only: for they imagin, that the Æ²n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is a Part of the Soul; but the Æ²nderstanding as far exceeds the Soul, as the Soul is better and diviner than the Body. Now this Composition of the Soul with the Æ²nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing makes Reason, and with the Body Passion: of which this is the Beginning or Principle of Pleasure and Pain, and that of Vertue and Vice. Of these three Parts, conjoyn'd and compacted together, the Earth has given the Body, the Moon the Soul, and the Sun the Æ²nderstanding to the Generation of Man. *** as therefore Brightness to the Moon. Now of the Deaths, we dy, the one makes Man two of three, and the other one of two. And the former indeed is in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Jurisdiction of</hi> Ceres, <hi>which is the Reason of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>r. The</hi> Athenians <hi>also heretofore call'd the Deceas'd</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>or</hi> Cerealians. <hi>As for the other Death, it is in the Moon, or Region of</hi> Proserpina. <hi>And as with the one the Terrestrial, so with the other the Celestial</hi> Mercury <hi>inhabits. This suddenly, and with Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence plucks the Soul from the Body; but</hi> Proserpina <hi>mildly, and in a long time disjoyns the Æ²nderstanding from the Soul. And for this Reason is she call'd</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that is,</hi> Only begotten, <hi>or rather,</hi> Begetting one alone; <hi>for the better Part of Man becomes alone, when it is separated by her. Now both the one and the other happens thus according to Nature. 'Tis ordain'd by Fate, that every Soul, whether with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Æ²nderstanding, when gone out of the Body, should wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a time, thÃ´ not all for the same, in the Region, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46328:118"/> between the Earth and the Moon. For those, that have been unjust and dissolute, suffer there the Punishments, due to their Offences; but the good and Vertuous are there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, till they are purify'd, and have by Expiation purg'd out of them all the Infections, they might have contracted from the Contagion of the Body, which is as it were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Evil, living in the mildest part of the Air, call'd the Meadows of</hi> Pluto, <hi>where they must remain for a certain prefixt and appointed time. And then, as if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from a wandring Pilgrimage or long Exile into their Country, they have a Taste of Joy, such, as they principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, who are initiated in sacred Mysteries, mixt with Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Admiration, and each ones proper and peculiar Hope. For it drives and chases out many Souls, which already long after the Moon. Some take Pleasure to be still below, and look yet again as it were downwards towards the Bottom; but those, that are got on high, are there most securely seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. First, they are, as Victors, crown'd with Garlands, call'd the Wings of Constancy, because in their Lives they restrain'd the unreasonable and passible part of their Soul, rendring it subject and obedient to the Curb of Reason. Secondly, They resemble in Sight the Rays of the Sun. Thirdly, The Soul, which is thus rais'd on high, is there confirm'd and fortify'd by the Air, which is about the Moon, where it gathers Strength and Solidity, as Iron and Steel do by their being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd and plung'd in Water.

                     </gap>r that, which was hitherto rare and loose, is compacted and made firm, and becomes bright, and transparent: so that 'tis nourisht with the least Exhalation in the World. And this is what</hi> Heraclitus <hi>meant, when he said, that the Souls in</hi> Pluto's <hi>Region have their Smell exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now they first see the Moons Greatness, Beauty, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is not simple and unmixt, but a Composition as it were of Earth and Star. For as the Earth, mixt with Wind and Moisture, becomes soft, and, as the Blood, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with the Flesh, gives it Sense: so they say, that the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46328:118"/> Moon, being mingled with an Aethereal Quintessence, even to the very Bottom, is animated, becomes fruitful and generative, and is equally counterpois'd with Ponderosity and Lightness. For even the World it self, being compos'd of some things, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally moving upwards, and others, by Nature tending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is exempt from all local Motion or Change of Place. These things also</hi> Xenocrates <hi>seems by a certain divine Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning to have understood, having taken his first Light from</hi> Plato. <hi>For</hi> Plato <hi>it was, who first affirm'd, that every Star is compounded of Fire and Earth, by the means of certain intermediate Natures, given in Proportion: forasmuch as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be an Object of human Sense, which has not in some Proportion a Mixture of Earth and Light. Now</hi> Xenocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes <hi>says, that the Stars and the Sun are compos'd of Fire and the first or primitive Solid, the Moon of the second Solid, and its own peculiar Air, and the Earth of Water, Fire, and the third Solid. For neither is the Solid alone by it self, nor the Rare alone by it self, capable or susceptible of a Soul. And let thus much suffice for the Substance of the Moon.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now as to her Breadth and Magnitude, 'tis not such as the Geometricians deliver, but manifoldly greater. And she sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom measures the Shadow of the Earth by her Greatness, not because it is small, but because it adds most fervent Motion, that she may quickly pass the shady Place, carrying with her the Souls of the Blessed, which make haste and cry. For when they are in the Shadow, they can no longer hear the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Heavenly Bodies. And withal, the Souls of the Damn'd are from below presented to them, lamenting and wailing thrÃ´ this Shadow. Wherefore also in Eclipses, many are wont to ring Vessels of Brass, and to make a Noise and Clattering about these Souls. Moreover, that which is call'd the Face of the Moon, affrights them, when they draw near it, seeming to them a dreadful and terrible Sight, whereas indeed it is not so. But as our Earth has deep and great Bayes, one here running between</hi> Hercules<hi>'s Pillars into
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46328:119"/> the Land to us, and others without, as the</hi> Caspian, <hi>and those about the</hi> Red Sea: <hi>so in the Moon also there are Hollows and great Depths, Now of these the greatest they call the Gulf of</hi> Hecate, <hi>where the Souls perish, or are punish'd according to the Evils, they did or suffer'd, whilst they were here. The two others are little Straits, thrÃ´ which the Soul must go sometimes to that part of the Moon, which is towards Heaven, and sometimes to that, which is towards Earth. Now that part of the Moon, which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, is call'd the</hi> Elysian <hi>Fields, and that, which is towards Earth, the Fields of</hi> Proserpina, <hi>not her, that is opposite to the Earth. Now the</hi> Daemons <hi>do not always stay in the Moon, but sometimes descend down here below to have the Care and Superintendency of Oracles: They are assistant also, and joyn in celebrating the sublimest Ceremonies, having their Eye upon Misdeeds, which they punish, and preserving the Good as well in Perils of War, as of the Sea. And if in the Performance of this Charge they commit any Fault, either thrÃ´ Anger, Envy, or any unjust Grace and Favor, they smart for it: for they are again thrust down to the Earth, and ty'd to Human Bodies. Now those, who were about</hi> Saturn, <hi>said, that themselves were some of the better of these</hi> Daemons, <hi>as were formerly those, that were heretofore in</hi> Crete <hi>call'd</hi> Dactyli Idaei, <hi>the</hi> Corybantes <hi>in</hi> Phrygia, <hi>and the</hi> Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoniades <hi>in</hi> Lebadia, <hi>a City of</hi> Boeotia, <hi>and infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in several Places of the Habitable Earth, whose Names, Temples, and Honors continue to this Day; but the Powers of some fail, being by a most happy Change translated to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place, which Translations some obtain sooner, others later, when the Æ²nderstanding comes to be separated from the Soul: which Separation is made by the Love and Desire to enjoy the Image of the Sun, in which, and by which, shines that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, desirable, and happy Beauty, which every other Nature diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently long after, and seeks, one after one manner, another af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another. For the Moon her self continually turns thrÃ´ the Desire, she has to be joyn'd with him. Thus the Nature of the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46328:119"/> Soul remains in the Moon, retaining only some Prints and Dreams of Life: And of this think it to have been well and truly said:</hi>
                  <q>The Soul, like to a Dream, flies quick away;</q>
                  <hi>which it does not immediately, as soon as it is separated from the Body; but afterwards, when it is alone, and divided, from the Æ²nderstanding. And of all, that</hi> Homer <hi>ever writ, there is not any one Passage more divine than that, in which speaking of those, who are departed this Life, he says,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Next these I saw <hi>Alcides</hi> Image move;</l>
                     <l>Himself is with th' Immortal Gods above.</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>For every one of us is neither Courage, nor Fear, nor Desire, no more than Flesh or Humors; but the Part, by which we think and understand: And the Soul, being moulded and form'd by the Æ²nderstanding, and it self moulding and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body, by embracing it on every side, receives from it an Impression and Form, so that, althÃ´ it be separated both from the Æ²nderstanding and the Body, it nevertheless so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains still its Figure and Semblance for a long time, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>And of these Souls, as I have already said, the Moon is the Element, because Souls resolve into her, as the Bodies of the Deceased do into Earth. Those indeed, who have been vertuous and honest, living a quiet and philosophical Life, without embroiling themselves in troublesome Affairs, are quickly resolv'd, because being left by the Æ²nderstanding, and no longer using corporeal Passions, they incontinently vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but the Souls of the Ambitious, and such as have been busy'd in Negotiations, of the Amorous, and who have been addicted to Corporeal Pleasures, as also of the Angry and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, calling to mind the things they did in their Lives,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46328:120"/> as Dreams in their Sleep, walk wandring about here and there, like that of</hi> Endymion: <hi>because their Inconstancy, and their being over subject to Passions, transports them, and draws them out of the Moon to another Generation, not letting them rest, but alluring them, and calling them away. For there is nothing small, staid, constant, and accordant, after that being forsaken by the Æ²nderstanding, they come to be seiz'd by corporeal Passions. And of such Souls,</hi>

                  <hi>destitute of all Reason, and suffering themselves to be carry'd away by the proud Violence of all Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, came and were bred afterwards the</hi> Tityi, <hi>and</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons, <hi>and particularly that</hi> Typhon, <hi>who, having by Force and Violence seiz'd the City of</hi> Delphi, <hi>overturn'd the Sanctuary of the Oracle there. Nevertheless, after a long Tract of Time, the Moon receives those Souls, and re-composes them: and the Sun, inspiring again, and sowing Æ²nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in their vital Faculty, makes them new Souls: and the Earth a third time gives them a Body. For she gives nothing after Death of all, that she takes to Generation: And the Sun takes nothing, but resumes and receives again the Æ²nderstanding, which he gave. But the Moon gives and receives, joyns and disjoyns, unites and separates, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to divers Faculties and Powers: of which the one is nam'd</hi> Ilithyia, <hi>or</hi> Lucina, <hi>to wit, that, which joyns; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Artemis, <hi>or</hi> Diana, <hi>to wit, that, which separates and divides. And of the three Fatal Goddesses or</hi> Parcae, <hi>she, which is call'd</hi> Atropos, <hi>is plac'd in the Sun, and gives the Principle of Generation; and</hi> Clotho, <hi>being lodg'd in the Moon, is she, who joyns, mingles, and unites; and the last, nam'd</hi> Lachesis, <hi>is on the Earth, where she adds her help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand, and with her does Fortune very much participate. For that which is without a Soul, is weak in it self; and liable to be affected by others: the Æ²nderstanding is Soveraign over all the rest, and cannot be made to suffer by any. Now the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46328:120"/> Soul is a certain middle thing, mixt of them both: as the Moon was by God made and created a Composition and Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things high and low, having the same Proportion to the Sun, as the Earth has to her.</hi>

               <p>This indeed is but a fiction and fansy, but the Fare it self is truly monstrous and prodigious; that a Man should have a Stomach to Creatures while they yet bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and that he should be giving directions which of things yet alive and speaking is fittest to make Food of, and ordering the several manners of the seasoning, and dressing them, and serving them up to Tables. You ought rather in my opinion to have enquired who first began this Practice, than who of late Times left it off. And truly as for those People who first ventured upon Eating of Flesh, it is very probable that the whole reason of their so doing, was scarcity and want of other Food. For it is not likely that their living together in lawless and extravagant lusts, or their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wanton and capricious through the excessive va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Provisions then among them, brought them to such unsociable Pleasures as these, against Nature. Yea, had they at this instant but their sense and voice restored to them, I am perswaded they would express themselves to this purpose. Oh! Happy you, and highly favoured of the Gods, who now live! Into what an Age of the World are you fallen, who share and enjoy among you a plentiful Portion of good things! What abundance of things spring up for your use! What Fruitful Vineyards you enjoy! What wealth you gather from the Fields! What delicacies from Trees and Plants which you may gather! You may glut and fill your selves without being polluted. As for us, we fell upon the most dismal and affrighting part of time, in which we were exposed by our first Production to manifold and inextricable wants and necessities. As yet the thickned Air concealed the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from our view, and the Stars as yet confus'd with a disorderly huddle of fire and moist and violent Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Winds.

                  <hi>round about you: And then again return'd behind you, twisting about the Fruitful Seasons, like Garlands upon a Cup. The Land was also spoiled by the Inundations of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Rivers: And a great part of it was deformed with Loughs, and utterly wild by reason of deep Quagmires, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertile Forrests and Woods.</hi> There was then no producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of tame Fruits, nor any Instrument of Art, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Wit. And hunger gave no time, <hi>nor did Seed-time then stay for the yearly Seasons.</hi> What wonder is it if we made use of the Flesh of Beasts contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when Mud was Eaten and the Bark of Wood, and when it was thought a happy thing to find either a sprouting Grass, or a Root of any Plant. But when they had by chance tasted of, or eaten, an Akorn, they danced for very joy about some <hi>Oak</hi> or <hi>Esculus,</hi> calling it by the Names of <hi>Life-giver, Mother</hi> and <hi>Nourisher:</hi> And this was the only Festival that those times were acquainted with: Upon all other occasions all things were full of anguish and dismal sadness. But whence is it that a certain ravenousness and frenzy drives you in these happy days to pollute your selves with Blood, since you have such an abundance of things necessary for your subsistence? Why do you belye the <hi>Earth</hi> as unable to maintain you? Why do you profane the <hi>Law-giver Ceres,</hi> and shame the <hi>Mild</hi> and <hi>Gentle Bacchus,</hi> as not furnishing you with sufficiency? Are you not ashamed to mix tame Fruits with Blood and Slaughter? You are indeed wont to call <hi>Serpents, Leopards</hi> and <hi>Lions</hi> Savage Creatures, but yet your selves are defiled with Blood; and come nothing behind them in cruelty. What they kill is their ordinary nourishment, but what you kill indeed is your better fare. For we eat not <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Wolves</hi> by way of revenge: But let those go, and catch the harmless, and tame sort, and such as have neither Stings nor Teeth to bite with, and slay them; which so may <hi>Jove</hi> help us, nature seems to us
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46328:122"/> to have produced for their beauty and comeliness only. Just as if one seeing the River <hi>Nilus</hi> over-flowing its Bancks and thereby filling the whole Country with genial and fertile moisture, should not at all admire that secret power in it that produces Plants and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of most sweet and useful Fruits, but beholding somewhere a <hi>Crocodile</hi> swimming in it, or an <hi>Aspe</hi> crawling along, or <hi>Flyes,</hi> (Savage and filthy Creatures) should presently affirm these to be the occasion of all that is amiss, or of any want or defect that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Or as if indeed one contemplating this Land or Ground, how full it is of tame Fruits, and how heavy with Ears of Corn, should afterwards espy somewhere in these same Corn-feilds an Ear of <hi>Darnel</hi> or a <hi>Wild Vetch,</hi> and thereupon neglect to reap and gather in the Corn, and fall a complaining of these. Such another thing it would be, if one seeing the Harangue of some Advocate at some Bar or Pleading, swelling and enlarging and hastening towards the relief of some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending danger, or else, by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in the impeaching and charging of certain audacious Villanies or Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, flowing and rowling along, and that not in a simple and poor strain, but with many sorts of passions all at once, or rather indeed with all sorts, in one and the same manner, into the many, and various and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering minds of either Hearers or Judges, that he is either to turn and change; or else, by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, appease and quiet; should overlook all this business, and never consider or reckon up the labour or struggle he had undergone, but pick up certain loose expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which the rapid motion of the discourse had carried along with it as by the stream of its current, and so had slipt and escap'd the rest of the Oration; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon undervalue the Orator. But we are nothing put out of countenance, either by the beautious gayity of the colours, or by the charmingness of the Musical
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:46328:123"/> Voices, or by the rare Sagacity of the Intellects, or by the cleanliness and neatness of Diet, or by the rare discretion and prudence of these poor unfortunate Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; but for the sake of some little mouthful of Flesh, deprive a Soul of the Sun and Light and of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Life and Time it had been Born into the World to enjoy. And then we fancy that the Voices it utters and screams forth to us are nothing else but certain inarticulate sounds and noises, and not the several Deprecations, Entreaties, and Pleadings of each of them, as it were saying thus to us; I deprecate not thy necessity (if such there be) but thy wantoness: Kill me for thy feeding: But do not take me off for thy better feeding. O horrible cruelty! It is truly an affecting sight to see the very Table of Rich People laid before them, who keep them Cooks and Caterers to furnish them with Dead Corpses for their daily Fare: But it is yet more affecting to see it taken away, for there is more mammocks left than was eaten. These therefore were slain for no purpose. Others there are that though they have abstained from what had been set before them, yet will not suffer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to cut or slice what they themselves had rejected; and yet would not abstain from them while alive. Well then, we understand that that sort of Men are us'd to say, that in eating of Flesh they follow the conduct and direction of Nature. But that it is not natural to Mankind to feed on Flesh, we first of all demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate from the very Shape and Figure of the Body. For a human Body no way resembles those that were Born for ravenousness: It hath no Hawk-bill; no sharp Tallon; no roughness of Teeth; no such strength of Stomach, or heat of digestion as can be sufficient to convert or alter such heavy and fleshy Fare. But even from hence, that is from the smoothness of the Tongue, and the slowness of the Stomach to digest Nature seems to disclaim all pretence to Fleshy Victuals. But if
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46328:123"/> you will contend that your self was Born to an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to such Food, you have now a mind to eat: Do you then your self kill, what you would eat. But do it your own self; without the help of a Chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Knife, Mallet or Axe; as Wolves, Bears and Lyons do, who kill and eat at once. Rend an Oxe with thy Teeth, worry a Hog with thy Mouth, tear a Lamb or a Hare in pieces, and fall on and eat it alive as they do. But if thou hadst rather stay until what thou eatest is become dead, and if thou art loath to force a Soul out of its Body, why then dost thou against Nature eat an Animate thing? Nay there is no body that is willing to eat even a lifeless and a dead thing as it is, but they Boyl it, and Roast it, and alter it by Fire and Medicines, as it were changing and quenching the slaughtered Gore with Thousands of sweet Sawces, that the Palate being thereby deceived, may admit of such uncouth Fare. It was indeed a witty Expression of a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> who having purchased a small Fish in a certain Inn, delivered it to his Landlord to be dressed: And as he demanded Cheese and Vinegar and Oyl to make Sawce, he replyed, if I had had those I would not have bought the Fish. But we are grown so wanton in our bloody Luxury, that we have bestowed upon Flesh the Name of Meat, and then require another Meat to this same Flesh, mixing <hi>Oyl, Wine, Honey, Pickle,</hi> and <hi>Vinegar</hi> with <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Spices, as though we really meant to embalm it after its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease. Indeed when things are dissolved, and made thus tender and soft, and are as it were turned into a sort of a Carriony Corruption, it must needs be a great difficulty for Concoction to master them, and when it hath mastered them, they must needs cause grievous oppressions, and qualmy indigestions. <hi>Diogenes</hi> ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured once to eat a raw Pourcontrel, that he might
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:46328:124"/> disuse himself from Meat dressed by Fire: And as several Priests and other People stood round him, he wrapp'd his head in his Cassock and so putting the Fish his to Mouth, he thus said unto them: <hi>It is for your sakes, Sirs, that I undergo this danger, and run this risk; a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Gallant risque, by Jupiter. For</hi> no otherwise than as <hi>Pelopidas</hi> ventured his Life for the Liberty of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and <hi>Harmodius</hi> and <hi>Aristogiton</hi> for that of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> did this Philosopher encounter with a raw Pourcontrel, to the end he might make human Life more brutish. Moreover these same Flesh-eatings are not only preternatural to Mens Bodies, but also by clogging and cloying them render their very Minds and Intellects gross also. For it is well known to most that Wine and much Flesh-eating make the Body indeed strong and lusty, but the mind weak and feeble. And that I may not offend the Wrestlers, I will make use of Examples out of my own Country. The <hi>Athenians</hi> are wont to call us <hi>Boeotians Gross, Senseless</hi> and <hi>Stupid</hi> Fellows, for no other reason but our over much eating. And sometimes also <hi>Hogs</hi> for the same reason. <hi>Menander</hi> the <hi>Comoedian,</hi> calls us, <hi>Fellows with long Jawes.</hi> It is observed also, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the saying of <hi>Heraclitus, A dry light has the wisest Soul.</hi> Earthen jars if you strike them will sound, but if they be full they perceive not the strokes that are given them. Copper Vessels also that are thin communicate their sound round about them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less some one stop and dull the ambient stroke with his Fingers. Moreover the Eye when seized with an over great plenitude of humors grows dim and feeble for its ordinary work. When we behold the Sun through a humid Air and a great quantity of gross and indigested vapours, we do not see it clear and bright, but obscure and cloudy and with glimmering Beams. Just so in a muddy and clogged
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46328:124"/> Body, that is swagged down with heavy and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural nourishments, it must needs happen that the gayety and splendor of the Mind be confused and dulled, and that it ramble and rowl after little and scarce discernible Objects, since it wants clearness and vigour for higher things. But to pass by these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is not accustoming ones self to mildness and an human temper of mind an admirable thing? For who could wrong or injure a Man that is so sweetly and humanly disposed with respect to the ills of strangers that are not of his kind? I remember that three days ago, as I was discoursing, I made mention of a Saying of <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> and how the <hi>Athenians</hi> gave Judgment upon a certain Person who had flayed a living Ram. For my part I cannot think him a worse Criminal that torments a poor Creature while living than a Man that shall take away its Life and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it. But (as it seems) we are more sensible of what is done against Custom than against Nature. These are now their more common and vulgar Reasonings upon this Subject. As for that grand and mysterious Principle which (as <hi>Plato</hi> speaks) is incredible to base minds, and to such as affect only mortal things, I as little care to move in this discourse, as a Pilot doth a Ship in a Storm, or a Comoedian his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine while the Scences are moving. But perhaps it would not be amiss by way of Introduction and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to strike up and Sing certain Verses of <hi>Empedocles.</hi> For in those by way of Allegory he hints at Mens Souls, as that they are tyed to mortal Bodies, to be punished for Murthers, eating of Flesh, and of one another. Although this Doctrine seems much ancienter than his time. For the Fables that are storyed and related about the discerption of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the <hi>Titans</hi> upon him, and of their tasting of his slain Body, and of their several punishments
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46328:125"/> and Fulminations afterwards, are but a Representation of the <hi>Regeneration.</hi> For what in us is unreasonable, disorderly and boisterous, being not Divine but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, the Ancients termed <hi>Titans,</hi> and that is it that is to suffer torments, and to undergo vengeance after death.</p>

               <byline>Translated from the <hi>Greek</hi> by the same hand.</byline>
               <p>REason persuades us now to return with fresh Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Dispositions to what we left cold yesterday of our Discourse about Flesh-Eating. It is indeed a hard and a difficult task to undertake (as <hi>Cato</hi> once said) to dispute with Mens Bellys that have no Ears; since most have already drunk that <hi>Draught</hi> of Custom, which is like that of <hi>Circe,</hi>
                  <q>Of groans and frauds and sorcery replete.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And it is no easy Task to pull out the Hook of Flesh-Eating from the Jaws of such as have gorged themselves with Luxury, and are as it were nailed down with it. It would indeed be a good action, if as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> draw out the Stomach of a dead Body, and cut it open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it to the Sun, as the only cause of all its evil Actions, so we could by cutting out our Gluttony and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46328:126"/> purifie and cleanse the remainder of our lives. For the Stomack it self is not guilty of Bloodshed, but is involuntarily polluted by our intemperance. But if this may not be, and we are ashamed by reason of custom to live unblameably, let us at least sin with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: Let us eat flesh, but let it be for hunger, and not for wantonness. Let us kill an Animal but let us do it with sorrow and pity, and not abusing and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as many now a days are used to do, while some run red hot Spits through the Bodies of Swine, that by the tincture of the quenched Iron the Blood may be to that degree mortified, that it may sweeten and soften the Flesh in its circulation: and others jump and stamp upon the Udders of Sows that are ready to Pig, that so they may take off (Oh! <hi>Piacular Jupiter,</hi>) in the very pangs of delivery, Blood, Milk and Corruption, (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the young ones besides) and so eat the most inflam'd and diseased Part of the Animal: others sow up the Eyes of Cranes and Swans, and so shut them up in darkness to be fatned, and then sowce up their flesh with certain monstrous Mixtures and Pickles. By all which it is most manifest, that it is not for nourishment, or want, or any necessity, but for meer gluttony, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness and expensiveness that they make a Pleasure of Villany. Just as it happens in such Persons as when they cannot satiate their Intemperance upon Women, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made tryal of every thing else, and falling into vagaries, at last attempt things not to be mentioned: even so inordinateness in feeding, when it hath once passed the bounds of nature and necessity, studies at last to diversify the Lusts of its intemperate Appetite by cruelty and villany. For the Senses when they once quit their natural Measures, sympathize with each other in their distempers, and are enticed by each other to the same consent, and intemperance. Thus a distempered Ear first debauched Musick, the soft and effeminate
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46328:126"/> Notes of which provoketh immodest touches and lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tickling. These things first taught the Eye not to delight in merry Jiggs, gesticulations of Hands, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and BorÃ©es, nor in Statues and fine Paintings; but to reckon the slaughtering and death of Mankind, and Wounds and Duels, the most sumptuous of Shewes and Spectacles. Thus unlawful Tables are accompanied with intemperate Copulations with unmusicianlike Balls, and Theatres become Monstrous through shameless Songs and Rehearsals: and Barbarous and Brutish Shews are again accompanied with an unrelenting temper and savage cruelty towards Mankind. Hence it was that the Divine <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in his Three Books of Laws (called by him <hi>Rhetrae</hi>) gave Orders that the Doors and Ridges of Mens Houses should be made with a Saw and an Ax, and that no other Instrument should so much as be brought to any House. Not that he did hereby intend to declare War against Augres and Planes, and other Instruments of finer Work; but because he very well knew that with such Tools as these, you will never bring into your House a guilded Couch, and that you'l never attempt to bring into a slender Cottage either Silver-Tables, Purple-Carpets, or Costly-Stones: But that a plain Supper and a homely Dinner must accompany such a House, Couch, Table and Cup. The beginning of a vitious Diet is presently followed by all sorts of Luxury and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensiveness:
<q>Ev'n as a Mare is by her thirsty Colt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And what Meal is not expensive, for which an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is put to death? Shall we reckon a Soul to be a small expense? I will not say perhaps of a Mother, or a Father, or of some Friend, or Child, as <hi>Empedocles</hi> did; but one participating of Feeling, of Seeing, of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:46328:127"/> of Imagination and of Intellection; which each of them hath received from nature for the acquiring of what is agreeable to it, and the avoiding what is disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. Do but consider this with your self now, which sort of Philosophers render us most tame and civil, they who bid People to feed on their Children, Friends, Fathers and Wives, as if they were dead; or <hi>Phythagoras</hi> and <hi>Empedocloes,</hi> that accustom Men to be just towards even the other Members of the Creation. You laugh at a Man that will not eat a Sheep: But we (they'l say again) when we see you cutting off the Parts of your dead Father, or Mother, and sending it to your absent Friends, and calling upon and inviting your present Friends to eat the rest freely and heartily, shall we not smile? Nay peradventure we offend at this instant time while we touch these Books without having first cleansed our Hands, Eyes, Feet and Ears: if it be not (by <hi>Jupiter</hi>) a sufficient purgation of them, to have discoursed of these Matters in potable and fresh Language (as <hi>Plato</hi> speaketh) thereby washing off the brackishness of Hearing. Now if a Man should set these Books and Discourses in opposition to each other, he will find that the Philosophy of the one sort, suites with the <hi>Seythians, Sogdians</hi> and <hi>Melanchlaenians</hi> of whom <hi>Herod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> his Relation is scarce believed: but the Sentiments of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Empedocles</hi> were the Laws and Customs of the ancient <hi>Grecians.</hi> Who then were the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this opinion, that we owe no Justice to dumb Animals?</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Who first beat out accursed Steel,</l>
                  <l>And made the lab'ring Oxe a Knife to feel.</l>
               </q>
               <p>In the very same manner Oppressors and Tyrants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin first to shed Blood. For example, the first Man that the <hi>Athenians</hi> ever put to death, was one <hi>Epitedius,</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:46328:127"/> the basest of all Knaves; after him they put to death a second and a third: After this being now accustomed to Blood, they patiently saw <hi>Niceratus</hi> the Son of <hi>Nicias,</hi> and their own General <hi>Theramenes,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemarchus</hi> the Philosopher suffer death. Even so in the beginning some wild and mischievous Beast was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and eaten, and then some little Bird or Fish was entrapped. And conquest being first experimented and exercised in these, at last passed even to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Oxe, and the Sheep that Cloathes us, and to the poor Cock that keeps the House: Until by little and little unsatiableness being strengthened by use, Men came to the slaughter of Men, to Blood-shed and Wars. Now if one cannot demonstrate and make out that Souls in their Regenerations make a promiscuous use of all Bodies, and that that which is now rational will at another time be irrational, and that again tame which is now wild (for that nature changes and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutes every thing;
<q>With different Fleshy Coats New Cloathing all.)</q> This thing should be sufficient to change a Man that hath taken up an intemperate and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Life, that it brings sickness and heavyness upon the Body, and that it inclines the mind the more bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishly to warm Blood-shed and destruction: When we have once accustomed our selves neither to entertain a Guest, nor keep a Wedding, nor to treat our Friends, without Blood a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Slaughter. And if what is argued about the return of Souls into Bodies is not of Force enough to beget Faith, yet methinks the very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the thing should fill us with apprehension and fear. Suppose for instance one should in some Night Engagement rush on with his drawn Sword up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one that had fallen down and covered his Body
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:46328:128"/> with his Arms, and should in the mean time hear one say, that he was not very sure, but that he fansyed and believed, that the party lying there, was his Son, Brother, Father, or Tent-companion; which were more advisable think you, to hearken to a false sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion and so to let go an Enemy under the notion of a Friend; or to slight an Authority not sufficient to beget faith, and to slay a Friend instead of a Foe? This you will all say would be insupportable. Do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the famous <hi>Merope</hi> in the Tragedy, who taking up a Hatchet and lifting it at her Sons Head, whom she took for her Sons Murtherer, speaks thus as she was ready to give the fatal blow;
<q>Villain, this piercing blow shall cleave thy head;</q> What a bustle she raises in the whole Theatre, while she raises her self to give the blow, and what a fear they are all in, least she should prevent the Old Man that comes to stop her hand, and should wound the Youth. Now if another Old Man should stand by her and say, <hi>strike it is thy Enemy,</hi> and this, <hi>hold it is thy Son;</hi> which think you would be the greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, to omit the punishing of an Enemy for the sake of ones Child, or to suffer ones self to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with anger at ones Enemy to Murther ones Child! Since then neither hatred, nor wrath, nor any revenge, nor fear for our selves, carries us to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Beast, but the poor sacrifice stands with an inclined neck only to satisfie thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>st and pleasure; and then one Philosopher stands by and tells thee, <hi>cut him down, it is but an unreasonable Animal;</hi> and another cries, <hi>hold: What if there should be the Soul of some Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or God inclosed in him?</hi> Good Gods! Is there the like danger if I refuse to eat Flesh; or if I for want of Faith Murther my Child, or some other Friend?
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46328:128"/> The <hi>Stoicks</hi> way of reasoning upon this Subject of <hi>Flesh-eating</hi> is no way equal nor consonant with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Who is this that hath so many Mouths for his Belly and the Kitchin? Whence comes it to pass that they so very much womanize and reproach Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as a thing that they will not allow to be either good, or preferable, or so much as agreeable, and yet all on a sudden become so zealous Advocates for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? It were indeed but a reasonable consequence of their Doctrine, that since they banish Perfumes, and Cakes from their Banquets, they should be much more averse to Blood and to Flesh. But now just as if they would reduce their Philosophy to their Diaryes, or Day-books, they lessen the expences of their Suppers in certain unnecessary and needless Matters, but the untam'd and Murtherous part of their expence they nothing boggle at. Well! What then (say they?) We have nothing to do with Brute Beasts? Nor have you any with Perfumes, nor with Foreign Sawces, (may some one answer:) And yet you every where expel these from your Banquets, as both useless and needless. Let us therefore in the next place consider, whether we owe any Justice to the Brute Beasts: Neither shall we handle this Point, artificially or like subtle Sophisters, but by casting our Eye into our own Breasts, and conversing with our selves as Men, we will weigh and examin the whole Matter. ******</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Fate.</head>
               <byline>Translated out of the <hi>Greek</hi> by <hi>A. G.</hi> Gent.</byline>
               <p>I Will endeavor, my dearest <hi>Piso,</hi> to send you my Opinion concerning <hi>Fate,</hi> written with all the Clearness and Compendiousness, I am capable of: since you, who are not ignorant, how cautious I am of writing, have thought fit to make it the Subject of your Request. You are first then to know, that this word <hi>(Fate)</hi> is spoken, taken, and understood two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Ways: the one, as it is an Action; the other, as it is a Substance. First therefore, as 'tis an Action, <hi>Plato</hi> has under a Type describ'd it, saying thus in his Dialogue, entitled <hi>Phaedrus: And this is a Sanction of</hi> Adrastea, <hi>or an inevitable Ordinance that whatever Soul being an Attendant on God:</hi> And in his Treatise, call'd <hi>Timaeus: The Laws, which God in the Nature of the Æ²niverse has establish'd for immortal Souls.</hi> And in his Books of a <hi>Common-weal</hi> he says, <hi>That Fate is the Speech of the Virgin</hi> Lachesis, <hi>who is the Daughter to Necessity.</hi> By which Sentences he not Tragically, but Theologically, shews
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46328:129"/> us, what his Sentiments are in this matter. Now, if any one, perhaps taking again the fore-cited Passages, would have them express'd in more familiar Terms, the Description in <hi>Phaedrus</hi> may be thus explain'd: <hi>That</hi> Fate <hi>is a divine Sentence, intransgressible thrÃ´ a Cause, which cannot be divested or hindred.</hi> And according to what he has said in his <hi>Timaeus, 'Tis a Law ensuing on the Nature of the Æ²niverse, according to which all things, that are done, are transacted.</hi> For this does <hi>Lachesis</hi> effect, who is indeed the Daughter of Necessity, as we have both already related, and shall yet better understand by that, which will be said in the Pogress of our Discourse. Thus you see, what <hi>Fate</hi> is, when 'tis taken for an Action; but, as it is a substance, it seems to be the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Soul of the World, and admits of a threefold Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution: the first Destiny being that, which errs not; the second that, which is thought to err; and the third that, which, being under the Heaven, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about the Earth. Of these the highest is call'd <hi>Clotho,</hi> the next <hi>Atropos,</hi> and the lowest <hi>Lachesis,</hi> who, receiving the celestial Influences and Efficacies of her Sisters, transmits and fastens them to the terrestrial things, which are under her Government. Thus have we declar'd, what is to be said of <hi>Fate,</hi> taken as a Substance, what it is, what are its Parts, after what manner it is, how it is ordain'd, and how it stands, both in respect to it self, and to us: but as to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities of these things, there is another Fable in his <hi>Common-weal,</hi> by which they are in some measure covertly insinuated, and we our selves have in the best manner, we can, endeavour'd to explain them to you.</p>
               <p>But we now once again turn our Discourse to <hi>Fate,</hi> as it is an Action: For concerning this it is, that there are so many Natural, Moral, and Logical Questions. Having therefore already in some sort sufficiently defin'd, what it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46328:130"/> it is, we are now in the next place to say something of its Quality, althÃ´ it may to many seem absurd. I say then, that <hi>Fate,</hi> thÃ´ comprehending as it were in a Circle the Infinity of all those things, which are and have been from infinit Times, and shall be to infinit Ages, is not it self infinit, but determinate and finit: for neither Law, Reason, nor any other divine thing can be infinit. And this you will the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, if you consider the Total Revolution, and the universal Time, when the Swiftness of the eight Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, that is, of the eight Spheres, having, as <hi>Timaeus</hi> says, finisht their Course, return to one and the same Point, being measur'd by the Circle of <hi>The same,</hi> which goes always after one manner. For in this Reason, which is finit and determinate, shall all things, which as well in Heaven as in Earth consist by Necessity from above, be reduced to the same Situation, and restor'd again to their first Beginning. Wherefore the only Habitude of Heaven, ordain'd in all things, as well in regard of it self, as of the Earth, and all terrestrial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, shall again after long Revolutions one day return, and those things, that in order follow after, and, being linkt together in a Continuity, are maintain'd in their Course, shall consequently also every one of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, what it brings by Necessity. Now for the better clearing of this matter, let us suppose, that all, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in us or about us, happens and is wrought by the Course of the Heavens and heavenly Influences, as being entirely the efficient Cause both of my writing, what I now write, and of your doing also, what you at present do, and in the same manner, as you do it. Hereafter then, when the same Cause shall return, we shall do the same things, we now do, and in the same manner, and shall again become the same Men: and so it will be with all others. And that, which follows after, shall also happen by the following Cause: and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46328:130"/> in brief all things, that shall happen in every one of these universal Revolutions, shall again become the same. By this it appears, as we have already said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Fate,</hi> being in some sort infinit, is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less determinate and finite: and it may be also in some sort seen and comprehended, as we have farther said, that it is as it were a Circle: for as the Motion of a Circle is a Circle, and the Time, that Measures it, is also a Circle: so the Reason of things, which are done, and happen in a Circle, may be justly esteem'd and call'd a Circle.</p>
               <p>This therefore, thÃ´ there should be nothing else, almost shews us, what sort of thing <hi>Fate</hi> is, but not particularly, or in every respect. What kind of thing then is it in its own form? It is, as far as one can compare it, like to the Civil or Politick Law. For first it commands the most part of things, if not all, at least <hi>by Supposition,</hi> and then it comprizes, as far as is possible for it, all things, that belong to the Publick in general: and the better to make you understand both the one and the other, we must specify them by an Example. The Civil Law speaks and ordains in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of a valiant Man, and also of a Deserter, and a Coward, and in the same manner of others; now this is not to make the Law speak of this or that Man in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; but principally to propose such things, as are universal or general, and consequently, such, as fall under them. For we may very well say, that 'tis le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal to reward this Man for having demean'd himself valiantly, and to punish that Man for flying from his Colors: because the Law has virtually, thÃ´ not in express terms, and particularly yet in such general ones, as they are comprehended under, so determin'd of them. As the Law, if I may so speak, of Physicians and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of corporal Exercises potentially comprehends par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and special things within the general: so the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46328:131"/> Law of Nature, determining first and principally gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Matters, secondarily and consequentially determins such, as are particular. Thus general things being decreed by <hi>Fate,</hi> particular and individual things may also in some sort be said to be so, because they are so by Consequence with the general. But perhaps some one of those, who more accurately examin, and more subtly search into these things, may say on the contrary, that particular and individual things precede the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of general things, and that the general is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd for the particular: now that, for which another thing is, always goes before that, which is for it. Nevertheless this is not the proper Place to treat of this Difficulty; but 'tis to be remitted to another. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that <hi>Fate</hi> comprehends not all things clearly and expresly, but only such, as are universal and general, let it pass for resolv'd on at present, as well for what we have already said a little before, as for what we shall say hereafter. For that, which is finite and determinate, agreeing properly with divine Providence, is seen more in universal and general things, than in particular: such therefore is the divine Law, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Civil: but Infinity consists in Particulars and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals.</p>
               <p>After this we are to declare, what this Term, <hi>By Supposition,</hi> means: for 'tis to be thought, that <hi>Fate</hi> is also some such thing. That then is said to be <hi>by Supposition,</hi> which is not set down of it self or absolutely, but as truly suppos'd and joyn'd to another: which signifies a Suit and Consequence. <hi>And this is a Sanction of</hi> Adrastea, <hi>or an inevitable Ordinance, that whatever Soul, being an Attendant on God, shall see any thing of Truth, it shall till another Revolution be exempt from Punishment, and if it can always do the same, it shall never suffer any Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi> Thus you see, what is meant by this Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>By Supposition,</hi> and also universally. Now that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46328:131"/>
                  <hi>Fate</hi> is some such thing, is clearly manifest, as well from its Substance, as from its Name. For it is call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, as being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>dependent and link'd:</hi> and it is a Sanction or Law, because things are therein ordain'd and dispos'd consequentially, as is usual in Civil Government.</p>
               <p>We ought in the next place to consider and treat of mutual Relation and Affection: that is, what Reference and Respect <hi>Fate</hi> has to <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> what to <hi>Fortune,</hi> what also to <hi>that, which is in our Power,</hi> what to <hi>Contingent,</hi> and other such like things: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore we are to determin, how far and in what it is true or false, that <hi>All things happen and are done by, or according to,</hi> Fate: For, if the Meaning is, that all things are comprehended and contain'd in <hi>Fate,</hi> it must be granted, that this Proposition is true; and if any would farther have it so understood, that all things, which are done amongst Men, on Earth, and in Heaven, are plac'd in <hi>Fate,</hi> let this also pass as granted for the present: But if, as the Expression seems rather to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, the <hi>Being done by, or according to,</hi> Fate, signifies not all things, but that, which is a Consequent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on it, then it must not be said or granted, that <hi>all things happon and are done by, and according to,</hi> Fate; thÃ´ all things are so according to <hi>Fate,</hi> as to be compriz'd in it. For all things, that the Law compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, and of which it speaks, are not legal, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law: for it comprehends Treason, it treats of the cowardly Running away from ones Colors in time of Battle, of Adultery, and many other such like things, of which it cannot be said, that any one of them is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Neither indeed can I affirm of the performing a valorous Act in War, the killing of a Tyrant, or the doing any other vertuous deed, that it is legal: because that only is properly to be call'd legal, which is commanded by the Law. Now if the Law commands
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46328:132"/> these things, how can they avoid being Rebels against the Law, and Transgressors of it, who neither perform valiant Feats of Arms, kill Tyrants, nor do any other such remarkable Acts of Vertue? And if they are Transgressors of the Law, why is it not just, they should be punisht? But if this is not reasonable, it must then be also confess'd, that these things are not legal, or according to Law; but that Legal, and according to Law, is only that, which is particularly prescrib'd, and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly commanded by the Law, in any Action whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. In like manner those things only are fatal, and according to <hi>Fate,</hi> which are the Consequences of Causes preceding in the divine Disposition. So that <hi>Fate</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed comprehends all things, which are done; yet many of those things, that are comprehended in it, and almost all, that precede, should not, to speak properly, be pronounc'd to be fatal, or according to <hi>Fate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things being so, we are next in order to shew, how <hi>that, which is in us,</hi> to wit, <hi>Free-will, Fortune, Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, Contingent,</hi> and other like things, which are plac'd amongst the antecedent Causes, can consist with <hi>Fate,</hi> and <hi>Fate</hi> with them: for <hi>Fate,</hi> as it seems, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all things, and yet all these things do not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by Necessity, but every one of them according to the Principle of its Nature. Now the Nature of the <hi>Possible</hi> is to presubsist, as the <hi>Genus,</hi> and go before the <hi>Contingent;</hi> and the <hi>Contingent,</hi> as the Matter and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is to be presuppos'd to <hi>that, which is in us;</hi> and <hi>that, which is in us,</hi> or our <hi>Free-will</hi> ought, as a Master, to make use of the <hi>Contingent;</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> intercurs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>that, which is in us,</hi> or our <hi>Free-will,</hi> thrÃ´ the Property of the <hi>Contingent,</hi> which is to encline to either Part. Now you will more easily apprehend, what has been said, if you shall consider, that every thing, which is <hi>generated,</hi> and the <hi>Generation</hi> it self is not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>generative Faculty</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> is not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46328:132"/> without a <hi>Substance;</hi> as for example neither the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of Man, nor that, which is <hi>generated,</hi> is without a <hi>Power:</hi> but this <hi>Power</hi> is about Man, and Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is the <hi>Substance.</hi> Now the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Faculty</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Substance,</hi> which is the <hi>Powerful,</hi> and the <hi>Generation</hi> and the thing <hi>Generated,</hi> which are both <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibles.</hi> There being then these three things, the <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Powerful,</hi> and the <hi>Possible,</hi> before the <hi>Power</hi> can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist, the <hi>Powerful,</hi> must of necessity be presuppos'd, as its Subject, and the <hi>Power</hi> must also necessarily subsist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Possible.</hi> By this Deduction then may in some measure be understood and declar'd, what is meant by <hi>Possible,</hi> which may be thus grossly defin'd: <hi>Possible</hi> is that, which <hi>Power</hi> is able to produce; or yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, if to this same there be added, Provided there be nothing from without to hinder, or obstruct it. Now of <hi>Possible</hi> things there are some, which can never be hindred, as are those in Heaven, to wit, the Rising and Setting of the Stars, and the like to these; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may indeed be empeach'd, as are the most part of human things, and many also of those, which are done in the Air. The first, as being done by Necessity, are call'd <hi>Necessary;</hi> the others, which may fall one way or other, are call'd <hi>Contingent:</hi> and they may both thus be describ'd. The Necessary Possible is that, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is <hi>Impossible;</hi> and the <hi>Contingent Possible</hi> is that, whose contrary is also <hi>Possible.</hi> For that the Sun should set, is a thing both <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Possible,</hi> for as much as 'tis contrary to this, that the Sun should not set, which is <hi>Impossible;</hi> but that, when the Sun is set, there should be Rain, or not Rain, both the one and the other, is <hi>Possible</hi> and <hi>Contingent.</hi> And then again of things contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent some happen oftner, others rarely and not so often: others fall out equally or indifferently, as well the one way as the other even as it happens. Now 'tis manifest, that those are contrary to one another, to wit, those, which fall
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46328:133"/> out oftner, to those, which happen but seldom, and, they are both for the most part in Natural things; but that, which happens equally, as much one way as another, <hi>is in us.</hi> For that under the Dog it should be either hot or cold, the one oftner, the other seldomer, are both things Subject to Nature; but to walk, and not to walk, and all such things, of which both the one and the other are submitted to the <hi>Free-will</hi> of Man, are said <hi>to be in us,</hi> and our Election, but rather more generally to be in us. For there are two sorts of this <hi>Being in us:</hi> the one, which proceeds from some sudden Passion and Motion of the Mind, as from Anger, or Pleasure; the other from the Discourse and Judgment of Reason, which may properly be said to be in our Election. And some Reason there is, that this <hi>Possible</hi> and <hi>Contingent,</hi> which is said to <hi>be in us,</hi> and according to our <hi>Free-will,</hi> should not be call'd in other Respects the same: for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Future 'tis stil'd <hi>Possible</hi> and <hi>Contingent;</hi> and in respect of the Present 'tis nam'd <hi>In us,</hi> and in our <hi>Free-will.</hi> So that these things may thus be defin'd: The <hi>Contingent</hi> is that, which is both it self, and its contrary <hi>Possible:</hi> and <hi>That, which is in us,</hi> is either part of the <hi>Contingent,</hi> to wit, that, which is presently in doing according to our Will. Thus have we in a manner declar'd, that the <hi>Possible</hi> in the Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture precedes the <hi>Contingent,</hi> and that the <hi>Contingent</hi> subsists before <hi>That, which is in us;</hi> as also what each of them is, whence they are so nam'd, and what are the Qualities, adjoyn'd or appertaining to them.</p>
               <p>It now remains, that we treat of <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Casual Adventure,</hi> and whatever else is to be considered with them. 'Tis therefore certain, that Fortune is a Cause: Now of Causes there are some, which are Causes of themselves and by themselves, and others by Accident. Thus for Example, the proper Cause by it self of an House or of a Ship is the Art of the Mason, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46328:133"/> or the Shipwright; but by Accident Musick, Geometry, and whatever else may happen to be join'd with the Art of building Houses or Ships, in respect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Body, the Soul, or any exterior things. Whence it appears, that the Cause by it self must needs be determinate, certain, and one; but the Causes by Accident are never one and the same, but infinit and undetermin'd: for many, nay infinit, Accidents, wholly different one from the other, may be in one and the same Subject. This Cause therefore by Accident, when it is found in a thing, that is done for some End, and that is in our <hi>Free-Will</hi> and Election, is then call'd <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:</hi> as is the finding a Treasure, while one is digging a Ditch, or making an Hole to plant a Tree; or the doing or suffering some extraordinary thing, whilst one is flying, following, or otherwise walking, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turning about, provided it be not for the sake of that, which happens, but for some other Intention. Hence it is, that some of the Ancients have declar'd <hi>Fortune</hi> to be a Cause unknown, and that cannot be foreseen by the Discourse of human Reason. But <hi>according</hi> to the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicks,</hi> who have approach'd yet nearer to the true Reason of it, 'tis thus defin'd: <hi>Fortune</hi> is a Cause by Accident in those things, which are done for some End, and which are in our Election: and afterwards they add, that 'tis unforeseen and unknown to the Discourse of human Reason: althÃ´ that, which is rare and strange, appears also by the same means to be in this kind of Cause by Accident. But what this is, if 'tis not sufficiently evidenc'd by the Oppositions and Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations made against it, will at least most clearly be seen by what is written in <hi>Platoes Phaedo,</hi> where you will find these words. P H. <hi>Have you not heard, how and in what manner the Judgment pass'd?</hi> E H. <hi>Yes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: for there came one, and told us of it: at which we wondred very much, that, the Judgment having been given
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46328:134"/> long before, he dy'd a great while after. And what, Ã´</hi> Phaedo, <hi>might be the Cause of it?</hi> P H. <hi>It was a Fortune, which hapned to him, Ã´</hi> Echecrates: <hi>for it chanc'd, that the Day before the Judgment the Prow of the Galley, which the</hi> Athenians <hi>send every year to the Isle of</hi> Delos, <hi>was crown'd:</hi> In which Discourse it is to be observ'd, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>Which hapned to him,</hi> is not simply to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by <hi>Which was done,</hi> or <hi>Which came to pass,</hi> but much rather by <hi>which befel</hi> thrÃ´ the Concurrence of many Causes together, one being done against another. For the Priest crown'd the Ship, and adorn'd it with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands for another End and Intention, and not for the sake of <hi>Socrates;</hi> and the Judges also had for some other Cause condemn'd him. But the Event and Accident was very strange, and of such a Nature, that it might very well seem to have been effected by the Providence either of some human Creature, or rather indeed of some Superior Powers. And so much may suffice as to the Definition of <hi>Fortune,</hi> by which we have shewn, that it must of necessity subsist with some one of those Contingent things, which are meant for some End: whence also it has its<note n="*" place="margin">Being call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Name: and we have farther taught, that there must be first some Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of such things, as are in Us and our <hi>Free-Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Casual Adventure</hi> is of a larger Extent than <hi>Fortune:</hi> which it comprehends, and also several other things, which may of their own Nature happen sometimes one way, sometimes another. And thus, as it appears by the Derivation of its Name, which is in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Chance</hi> is that, which happens instead of another, when that, which is ordinary, happens not, but another in its Place: such as Cold in the Dogdays seems to be; for it is sometimes then cold, and not in vain nor ** Once for all, <hi>as that, which is in us,</hi> and arbitrary, is a
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46328:134"/> Part of <hi>Contingent,</hi> so <hi>Fortune</hi> is a part of <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>casual Adventure,</hi> and both the two Events are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd and dependent on the one and the other, to wit, <hi>Chance</hi> on <hi>Contingent,</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> on <hi>That, which is in us,</hi> and arbitrary, and yet not on all, but on what is in our Election, as we have already said. Wherefore <hi>Chance</hi> is common to things inanimate, as well as to those, which are animated; whereas <hi>Fortune</hi> is proper to Man only, who has his Actions voluntary. And an Argument of this is, that to be fortunate and to be happy are thought to be one and the same thing: Now Happiness is a certain Well-doing, and Well-doing is proper only to Man, and to him perfect. These then are the things, which are compris'd in <hi>Fate:</hi> to wit, <hi>Contingent, Possible, Election, That, which is in us, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Chance,</hi> and their Adjuncts, as are the things sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd by these Words <hi>Perhaps</hi> and <hi>Peradventure:</hi> All which indeed are contain'd in <hi>Fate,</hi> yet none of them is <hi>fatal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It now remains, that we discourse of <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and shew, how it comprehends even <hi>Fate</hi> it self. The supreme therefore and first <hi>Providence</hi> is the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or, if you had rather, the Will of the first and soveraign God, doing good to every thing, that is in the World, by which all divine things have univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally and throughout been most excellently and most wisely ordain'd and dispos'd. The second <hi>Providence</hi> is that of the second Gods, who go thrÃ´ the Heaven, by which temporal and mortal things are orderly and regularly generated, and which pertains to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation and Preservation of every kind. The third may probably be call'd the <hi>Providence</hi> and Procuration of the <hi>Demons,</hi> which, being plac'd on the Earth, are the Guardians and Overseers of human Actions. This threefold <hi>Providence</hi> therefore being seen, of which the first and supreme is chiefly and principally so nam'd,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46328:135"/> we shall not be afraid to say, althÃ´ we may in this seem to contradict the Sentiments of some Philosophers, that all things are done by <hi>Fate</hi> and by <hi>Providence,</hi> but not also by Nature. But some are done according to <hi>Providence,</hi> and that different, these according to one, those according to another, and some according to <hi>Fate:</hi> and that <hi>Fate</hi> is altogether according to <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; Providence</hi> in no wise according to <hi>Fate.</hi> But let this Discourse be understood of the first and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>Providence.</hi> Now that, which is done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another, whatever it is, is always posterior to that, according to which it is done: As that, which is according to the Law, is after the Law, and that, which is according to Nature, after Nature: so that, which is according to <hi>Fate,</hi> is after <hi>Fate,</hi> and must consequently be more new and modern. Wherefore supreme Providence is the most ancient of all things, except him, whose Will or Understanding it is, to wit, the Sovereign Author, Maker, and Father of all things. <hi>Let us therefore,</hi> says <hi>Timaeus, discourse, for what cause the Creator made and fram'd this Machine of the Æ²niverse. He was good, and in him, that is good, there can never be imprinted or ingendred any Envy against any thing. Being therefore wholly free from this, he desir'd, that all things should, as far as it is possible, resemble himself. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who admits this to have been chiefly the most principal and proper Original of the Generation and Creation of the World, as it has been deliver'd to us by wise Men, receives that, which is most right. For God, who desir'd that all things should be good, and nothing, as far as possibly might be, evil, taking thus all, that was visible, restless as it was, and moving rashly and confusedly, reduc'd it from Disorder to Order, esteeming the one to be altogether better than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For it neither was nor is convenient for him, who is in all perfection good, to make any thing that should not be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46328:135"/> very excellent and beautiful.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and all that<note n="*" place="margin">for <gap reason="foreign">

Afterwards he speaks thus: <hi>Having fram'd the Æ²niverse, he ordain'd Souls equal in number to the Stars, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to each of them one, and having set them, as it were in a Chariot, shew'd the Nature of the Æ²niverse, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the Laws of</hi> Fate, Who then will not believe, that by these Words he expresly and manifestly declares <hi>Fate</hi> to be, as it were, a Foundation and political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Laws, fitted for the Souls of Men. Of which he also afterwards renders the Cause.</p>
               <p>As for the second <hi>Providence,</hi> he thus in a manner signifies it, saying: <hi>Having prescrib'd them all these Laws, to the end that, if there should afterwards happen any fault, he might be exempt from being the Cause of any of their Malice, he dispers'd some of them upon the Earth, some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Moon, and some into the other Instruments of Time. And after this Dispersion he gave in charge to the young Gods the making of human Bodies, and the making up and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, whatever was wanting and deficient in human Soul, and that, after they had perfected, whatever is adherent and consequent to this, they should rule and govern in the best manner, they possibly could, this mortal Creature, to the end it should not be the Cause of its own Evils.</hi> For by these Words, <hi>that he might be exempt from being the Cause of any of their Malice,</hi> he most clearly signifies the Cause of <hi>Fate:</hi> and the Order and Office of the young Gods manifests the second <hi>Providence:</hi> and it seems also in some sort to have touch'd a little upon the third, if he therefore establish'd Laws and Ordinances, <hi>that he might be exempt from being the Cause of any of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</hi> For God, who is free from all Malice, has no need of Laws or <hi>Fate;</hi> but every one of these petty
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46328:136"/> Gods, drawn by the <hi>Providence</hi> of him, who has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred them, performs what belongs to his Office. Now that this is true, and agreeable to the Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> these Words of the Lawgiver, spoken by him in his Book <hi>of Laws,</hi> seem to me to give sufficient Testimony. <hi>If there were any Man so sufficient by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by divine Fortune so happily engendred and born, that he could comprehend this, he would have no need of Laws, to command him: For there is not any Law or Ordinance, more worthy and powerful than Knowledge; nor is it fit, that he, who is truly and really free by Nature, should be a Subject or Slave to any one, but he ought to command all.</hi> I therefore do for mine own part thus understand and interpret this Sentence of <hi>Plato:</hi> There being a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Providence;</hi> the first, as having engendred <hi>Fate,</hi> does in some sort comprehend it; the second, having been engendred with <hi>Fate,</hi> is with it totally compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and embrac'd by the first; the third, as having been engendred after <hi>Fate,</hi> is comprehended by it in the same manner as are <hi>That, which is in us,</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> as we have already said. <hi>For they, whom the Assistance of a</hi> Daemons <hi>Power does aid, are those,</hi> (says <hi>Socrates,</hi> declaring to <hi>Theages,</hi> what is the inevitable Ordinance of <hi>Adrastea) whom you also mean: for they grew and come forward with speed.</hi> In which Words, what he says of a <hi>Daemons aiding</hi> some is to be ascrib'd to the third <hi>Providence;</hi> and the <hi>growing and coming for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with speed</hi> to <hi>Fate.</hi> In brief 'tis not obscure or doubtful, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> sound much more probable, that the second <hi>Providence</hi> is also comprehended under <hi>Fate;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all things, that are done: since <hi>Fate,</hi> as a Substance, hus been rightly by us divided into three Parts. And the Discourse of the Chain comprehends the Revolutions of the Heavens in the Numbers and Rank of those things, which happen <hi>by Supposition:</hi> but
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46328:136"/> concerning these things I will not much contend, to wit, whether they should be call'd <hi>Hapning by Supposition,</hi> or rather Conjoyn'd with <hi>Fate,</hi> the precedent Cause and Commander of <hi>Fate</hi> being also fatal. Our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then, to speak compendiously, is such. But the contrary Sentiment does not only include all things in <hi>Fate,</hi> but affirms them all to be done by and according to <hi>Fate.</hi> Now all things accord <hi>to the Other,</hi> and that which accords to another, 'tis clear, that it is also <hi>the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> According to this Opinion then <hi>Contingent</hi> is said to be the first; and, <hi>That which is in us,</hi> the second; and the third <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Chance,</hi> and whatever depends on them; Praise, Blame, and whatever depends on them, the fourth; the fifth and last of all may be said to be Prayers to the Gods, with their Services and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
               <p>For the rest, as to those, which are call'd <hi>I lle and Harvest</hi> Arguments, and that, which is nam'd <hi>Beside or against Destiny,</hi> they are indeed but vain Subtleties and captious Sophisms according to this Discourse. But according to the contrary Opinion, the first and principal Conclusion seems to be, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done without a Cause, but that all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon antecedent Causes: the second, that the World is govern'd by Nature, and that it conspires, consents, and is compatible with it self: the third seems rather to be Testimonies: of which the first is Divination, approv'd by all sorts of People, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly in God; the second is the Equanimity and Patience of wise Men, who take mildly, and bear pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently whatever befals, as hapning by divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and as it ought; the third is the Speech, so common and usual in every ones Mouth, to wit, that every Proposition is true or false. Thus have we contracted this Discourse into a small Number of short
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46328:137"/> Articles, that we might in few words comprehend the whole Matter of <hi>Fate.</hi> ** Into which a Scrutiny ought to be made, and the Reasons of both Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be weigh'd with a most exact Balance; but we are now coming to discuss Particulars. *****</p>

               <p>WHat is the reason, that Sea-water nourishes not Trees? Is it not for the same reason, that it nourishes not earthly Animals? For <hi>Plato, Anaxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> think, Plants are earthly Animals. Nor, though Sea-water be aliment to marine Plants, as it is to Fishes, will it therefore nourish earthly Plants; since it can neither penetrate the Roots, because of its grossness, nor ascend, by reason of its weight: for this, among many other things, shews Sea-water to be heavy and terrene, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it more easily bears up Ships and Swimmers. Or is it, because drought is a great Enemy to Trees? And Sea-water is of a drying faculty; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Salt resists putrefaction, and the Bodies of such as wash in the Sea, are presently dry and rough. Or is it, because Oyl is destructive to earthly Plants, and kills things anointed with it? But Sea-water participates of much fatness: for it burns together with it. Wherefore when Men would quench Fire, we forbid them to throw on Sea-water. Or is it because Sea-water is not fit to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46328:138"/> drink, and it is bitter (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> says) through a mixture of adust Earth? For a <hi>Lixivium</hi> is made by the falling of Ashes into Sweet-water, and the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ejects and corrupts what was good and potable, as in us Men Fevers convert the Humors into Bile. As for what Woods and Plants Men talk of growing in the Red-Sea, they bear no Fruit; but are nourished by Rivers, casting up much Mud: therefore they grow not at any great distance from Land, but very near to it.</p>
               <p>Why do Trees and Seeds thrive better with Rain than with Watring? Whether is it because (as <hi>Laitus</hi> thinks) showers parting the Earth by the violence of their fall, make passages, whereby the Water may more easily penetrate to the Root? This cannot be true; but <hi>Laitus</hi> never considered, that Marsh-Plants, as Cats-tail, Pond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeds and Moss neither thrive nor sprout, when the Rains fall not in their season. But it is true, what <hi>Aristotle</hi> said, Rain-water is new and fresh, that of Lakes old and exolete. And what if this be rather probable than true? For the Waters of Fountains and Rivers are ever fresh, new always arriving: Therefore <hi>Heraclitus</hi> said well, that <hi>no Man could go twice into the same River.</hi> And yet these very Waters nourish worse, than Rain-water. But Water from the Heavens is light and aÃ«rial, and being mixt with spirit, is the quicker passed and elevated into the Plant, by reason of its tenuity: for <hi>Pompholyx</hi> is made by mixture of Brass with the Air. That nourishes most, which is subacted by the thing nourished: for this very thing is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. On the contrary Inconcoction is, when the Aliment is stronger than to be affected by the thing nourished. Now, thin, simple and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>sipid things are the most easily altered, of which number is Rain-water, bred in the Air and Wind, which falls pure and sincere. But Fountain-water being assimilated to the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46328:138"/> Earth and Places through which it passes, is filled with many qualities, which render it less nutritive, and slower in alteration to the thing nourished. Moreover, that Rain-water is easily alterable, this is an Argument; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it sooner putrifies than either Spring or River-water. For Concoction seems to be Putrefaction, as <hi>Empedocles</hi> says, <hi>In the Barrel putrified Water becomes Wine.</hi> Or, which may most readily be assigned for a Reason, is it because Rain is sweet and mild, when it is presently sent by the Wind? For this reason Cattle drink it most greedily, and Frogs in expectation of it raise their Voice, as if they were calling for Rain to sweeten the Marsh, and to be Sawce to the Water in the Pools. For <hi>Aratus</hi> makes this a sign of approaching Rain.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>When wretched Frogs, to Watry Snakes sweet Food,</l>
                  <l>Their fathers Song do croak, and sing in Mud.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Why do Herdsmen set Salt before Cattel? Whether (as many think) to nourish them the more, and fatten them the better? For Salt by its acrimony sharpens the Appetite, and by opening the passages brings Meat more easily to digestion. Therefore <hi>Apollonius, Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> his Scholar, would not have lean Persons, and such as did not thrive, be fed with sweet things and Wheat, but ordered them to use Prickles and Salt things for their Food: whose tenuity serving instead of frication, might apply the aliment through the passages of the Body. Or is it for health's sake, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>t Men give Sheep Salt to lick, to cut off the redundance of nutriment? For when they are over fat, they grow sick, but Salt wasts and melts the Fat. And this they observe so well, that they can more easily fley them: For the Fat, which agglutinates and fastens the Skin, is made thin and weak by the acrimony. The Blood also of things that lick Salt, is attenuated: nor do things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:46328:139"/> the Body stick together, when Salts are mixt with them. Moreover consider this, whether the Cattel grow more fruitful, and more enclined to coition: For Bitches do sooner conceive, when they are fed with Salt Victuals: And Ships which carry Salt, are more peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Mice, by reason of their frequent coition.</p>
               <p>Why is the Water of Showers, Which fall in Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning, fitter to Water Seeds? For they are therefore called Thunder-showers. Is it, because they contain much Spirit, by reason of their confusion and mixture with the Air? For the Spirit moving the humor, sends it more upwards. Or is it, because Heat fighting against Cold causes Thunder and Lightning? Whence it is, that it Thunders very little in Winter; but in Spring and Autumn very much, because of the inequality of temper, and the heat concocting the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, renders it friendly and commodious for Plants. Or does it Thunder and Lighten most in the Spring for the foresaid cause, Seeds having great occasion for the Vernal Rain, before Summer? Therefore that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which is best Watred with Rain (as <hi>Sicily</hi> is) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces abundance of good Fruit.</p>
               <p>How comes it to pass, that since there be eight kinds of Tasts, we find the Salt in no Fruit whatever? Indeed at first the Olive is bitter, and the Grape acid; one whereof afterward turns fat, and the other vinous. But the acerb in Dates and the austere in Pomegranates turns sweet: Some Pomegranates and other Fruit have only a simple acid tast. The acrid is frequent in Roots and Seeds. Or is it, because no Salt taste is natural, but arises when the rest are corrupt? Therefore such Plants and Seeds as are nourished, receive no nourishment from Salt; it serves indeed some instead of Sawce, while it abates superfluity. Or, as Men take away saltness and bitingness from the Sea-water by distilling, is salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness so abolished in hot things by heat? Or indeed is
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46328:139"/> the taste (as <hi>Plato</hi> says) Water percolated through a Plant? And Sea-water percolated loses its saltness: For it is terrene and of gross Parts. Therefore People that dig near the Sea, happen upon Wells, fit to drink. Several also, that draw the Sea-water into waxen Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keets, receive it sweet and potable, the Salt and earthy part being percolated. Besides, Rest, and a long Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent makes Sea-water potable, when it contains in it self, and does not let go its earthy parts. And since things are so, it is very probable, either that Plants receive no Saltness extrinsically, or if they do, they put it not forth into Fruit; for things terrene and consisting of gross parts cannot pass, by reason of the straitness of the Passages. Or may saltness be reckoned a sort of bitterness? For so <hi>Homer</hi> says
<q>
                     <l>Out of his Mouth the bitter Brine did flow,</l>
                     <l>And down his body from his head did go.</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> also says, that both these tastes have an abstersive and colliquative faculty; but the Salt does it less, nor is it rough. And the bitter seems to differ from the Salt in abundance of heat: Since the Salt has also a drying quality.</p>
               <p>What is the reason, that if a Man frequently pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long dewy Trees, those Limbs that touch the Wood are seized with a Leprosy? Whether (as <hi>Laitus</hi> said) that by the tenuity of the Dew, the Moisture of the Skin is exhausted? Or as Smut and Mildew fall upon moistened Seeds, so when the green and tender Parts on the <hi>Superficies</hi> are eaten up and colliquated, a certain noxious taint is carried and imparted to the most blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Parts of the Body, and there eats and frets the Superficies? For that by nature there is a corrosive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in Dew, sufficiently appears, in that the drinking of it makes People lean: And gross Women gather it
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46328:140"/> either with Linen or Woollen Clothes, to take down their Flesh.</p>
               <p>Why in Winter do Ships sail flower in Rivers; but do not so in the Sea? Whether, because the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Air, which is at all times heavy and slow, being in Winter more condens'd by the Cold, does more resist Sailing? Or is it long of the Water rather than the Air? For the piercing Cold makes the Water heavy and thick, as one may perceive in an Hour-glass: For the Water passes more slowly in Winter than in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> talks of a Well about <hi>Pangaeum</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> how that a Vessel fill'd with the Water of it weighs twice as much in Winter, as it does in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Besides, hence it is apparent, that the grossness of the Water makes Ships Sail slower, because in Winter River-Vessels carry greater burthens: For the Water being made more dense and heavy, makes the more renitency. But the Heat hinders the Sea from being condensed.</p>
               <p>Why, since all other Liquors, upon moving and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about, grow cold, does the Sea by being toss'd in Waves grow hot? Whether, that motion expells and dissipates the heat of other Liquors as a thing asci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, and the Winds do rather excite and encrease the innate heat of the Sea. It's transparentness is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of heat, and so is it's not being condensed, thÃ´ it is terrene and heavy.</p>
               <p>Why in Winter is the Sea least bitter to the taste? For they say; that <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Hydragogue reptored, that the bitterness of the Sea was not devoid of all sweetness, as receiving so many Rivers into it. But by reason the Sun exhales the sweet and potable Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof, arising to the top by reason of its levity, and that in Summer, more than in Winter, when it affects the Sea more weakly by reason of the debility of its heat: Then a great deal of sweetness is left, which
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46328:140"/> tempers and mitigates its excessive, poysonous bitterness. And the same thing befals potable Waters: For in Summer they are worse, the Sun wasting the lightest and sweetest part of them. And a fresh sweetness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in Winter, of which the Sea must needs partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, since it moves, and is carried with the Rivers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea.</p>
               <p>Why do Men pour Sea-water upon Wine? They say the Fisher-men had an Oracle given them, whereby they were bid to dip <hi>Bacchus</hi> in the Sea, they that live far from the Sea, cast in some <hi>Lacynthian</hi> Earth tosted. Whether, that heat is good against cold? Or, that it quenches heat, by diluting the Wine and destroying its Strength? Or, that the aqueous and aerial part of Wine (which is therefore prone to mutation) is staid by the throwing in of terrene Parts, whose nature it is to constipate and condense? Moreover, Salts with the Sea-water atenuating and colliquating whatever is Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and superfluous, suffer no fetidness or putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to breed. Besides, the gross and terrene Parts being entangled with the heavy, and sinking together, make a Sediment or Lee, and so make the Wine fine.</p>
               <p>Why are they sicker that sail on the Sea, than they that sail in Fresh Rivers, even in Calm Weather? Of all the Senses, Smelling causes nauseousness the most, and of all the passions of the Mind, Fear. For Men tremble, and shake, and bewray themselves upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of great danger. They that Sail in a River are troubled with neither of these. And the smell of sweet and potable Water is familiar to all, and the Voyage is without danger. On the Sea an unusual smell is troublesom; and Men are affraid, not knowing what the issue may be. Therefore tranquillity abroad avails not, while an aestuating and disturbed Mind dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders the Body.</p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:46328:141"/>
               <p>Why does pouring Oyl on the Sea make it clear and calm? Is it, for that the Winds slipping the smooth Oyl, have no force, nor cause any Waves? This may be probably said in respect of things external; but they say, that Divers take Oyl in their Mouths, and when they spout it out they have light at the bottom, and it makes the Water transparent, so that the slipping of the Winds will not hold good here for an Argument. Therefore it is to be considered, whether the Sea, which is terrene and uneven, is not compact and made smooth by the dense Oyl: And so the Sea being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact in it self, leaves passages and a pellucidity pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable by the sight. Or whether that the Air, which is naturally mixt with the Sea, is lucid, but by being troubled grows unequal and shady: And so by the Oyl's density smoothing its inequality, the Sea recovers its evenness and pellucidity.</p>
               <p>Why do Fisher-mens Nets rot more in Winter than in Summer, since other things rot more in Summer? Is not that the cause, which <hi>Theophrastus</hi> assigns: That heat (to wit) shuns the cold, and is constrained by it on every side: Hence the Waters are hottest in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea? And so it is on Land: For Springs are hotter in Winter, and then Lakes and Rivers send up most vapors; because the heat is compelled to the bottom by the prevailing cold. Or it may be, Nets do not rot at that time more then at another. For being frozen and dried in the Cold, since they are therefore the more easily broken by the Waves, they are liable to something like putrefaction and rottenness. And they suffer most in the cold (as strained Nerves are aprest to break in such a Season) because than there be most frequent Storms at Sea. Therefore Fisher-men guard their Nets with certain Tinctures, for fear they should break. Otherwise a Net neither tinged nor daubed with any thing might more easily deceive the Fish; since Line is of an Air-color, and is is not easily discerned in the Sea.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:46328:141"/>
               <p>Why have the <hi>Doriens</hi> bad making of their Hay? Is it, because Hay rained upon is never well made? For the Grass is cut down green and not dry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it putrefies, when wet with Rain-water. But when before Harvest it rains upon Corn, this is a help to it against the hot South-Winds, which otherwise would not let the grain fill in the Ear; but by their heat would hinder and destroy all coalition, unless by watering the Earth there come a moisture, to cool and moisten the Ear.</p>
               <p>Why is a fat and deep Soyl Fruitful of Wheat, and a lean of Barley? Is it because a stronger Grain needs more nourishment, and a weaker a light and thin one? Now Barly is weaker and laxer than Wheat, therefore it affords but little nourishment. And, as a further Testimony to this reason, Wheat that is ripe in three Months, grows in dryer ground; because it is juyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and stands in need of less nourishment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is more easily brought to perfection.</p>
               <p>Why do Men say, <hi>Sow Wheat in Dirt, and Barly in Dust?</hi> Is the reason (as we said) because Wheat takes up more nourishment; And Barly cannot bear so much, but is choaked with it? Or does Wheat, because it is hard and lignous, thrive better, when it is softened and loosened in a moist Soyl, and Barly at the first: in a dry, because of its rarity? Or is the one temperament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous and harmless to Wheat, because it is hot: And the other to Barly, because it is cold? Or are Men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to Sow Wheat in a dry Soil, because of the Ants, which presently lye in wait for it; but they cannot so easily deal with Barly, nor carry it away, because it is a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger grain?</p>
               <p>Why do Men use the Hairs of Horses rather than Mares for Fishing-lines. Is it, that the Males are stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in these Parts, as well as in others, then the Females? Or is it, that the Females spoil the Hair of their Tails by bepissing them.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:46328:142"/>
               <p>Why is the sight of the Cuttle-fish a sign of a great Storm? Is it, because all Fishes of the soft kind cannot endure cold, by reason of their nakedness and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? For they are covered neither with Shell, Skin nor Skale, (thÃ´ within they have hard and bony Parts.) Hence the <hi>Greeks</hi> call them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> Soft Fish. Therefore they easily perceive a Storm coming, since they are so soon affected by the cold. When the <hi>Polypus</hi> gets to Shore, and embraces the Rocks, it is a sign the Wind is rising; but the Cuttle-Fish jumps up, to shun the cold and the trouble in the bottom of the Sea: For of all soft Fishes she is the tenderest and soonest hurt.</p>
               <p>Why does the <hi>Polypus</hi> change colour? Whether, as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> writes, because it is an Animal by nature time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and therefore being disturbed it changes colour with the Wind as some Men do (of whom it is said, <hi>an ill Man ever changes colour.</hi>) But though this may serve as a reason for changing its colour, it will not for the imitation of Colours. For the <hi>Polypus</hi> does so change its colour, that it is of the colour of every Stone it comes nigh: hence that of <hi>Pindar, Mind the colour of the Marine Beast and so converse cunningly in all Cities.</hi>

                  </q> And they say that such as are excellent at Craftiness and Jugling, have this in their Eye (that they may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cheat them they have to do withal) ever to imitate the <hi>Polypus.</hi> Some think the <hi>Polypus</hi> can use her Skin as a Garment, and can put it on or off at pleasure. But if fear occasion this change in the <hi>Polypus,</hi> is not some thing else more properly the cause? Let us consider what <hi>Empedocles</hi> say, that <hi>Effluvia proceed from all things
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46328:142"/> what ever.</hi> For not only Animals, Plants, the Earth and Sea, but Stones and even Brass and Iron do continually send out many <hi>Effluvia.</hi> For all things corrupt and smell, because there are always <hi>Effluvia.</hi> Drawing along or falling occasions <hi>Effluvia.</hi> Some suppose Embraces, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Blowes, some Impulses, others Circuitions. But especially about the Sea Rocks, when they are wet and cooled with the Waves: for some are of opinion, that constantly some small particles are washt off, which do not incorporate with other bodies, but either pass by the smaller passages, or pass through the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Now the flesh of the <hi>Polypus,</hi> as one may judge by the Eye, is hollow, full of Pores and capable of <hi>Effluvia.</hi> When therefore she is afraid, by changing breath, she changes her self, and by straitning and contracting her Body she encloses the neighbouring <hi>Effluvia.</hi> And, as a good Token of this Argument, the <hi>Polypus</hi> cannot imitate the colour of every thing he comes near, nor the Chamaeleon any thing that is white: But each of these Creatures is assimilated only to such things, as to whose <hi>Effluvia</hi> they have Pores proportionable.</p>
               <p>What is the reason, that the Tears of Wild-Boars are sweet, and the Tears oF the Hart salt and hurtful? The reason seems to be the Heat and Cold of these Animals: for the Hart is cold, and the Boar is very hot and fiery; therefore he flies from, and this defends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against his pursuers: for when great store of heat comes to the Eyes, (as <hi>Homer</hi> says, <hi>With horrid Bristles, and Eyes darting fire</hi>) Tears are sweet. Some are of <hi>Empedocles</hi> his opinion, who thought that Tears proceed from the disturbance of the Blond as <hi>Serum</hi> does from the Churning of Milk: since therefore Boar's blood is harsh and black, and Hart's blood thin and watry; it is consentaneous, that the Tears should be such, as the one sheds excited to anger, and the other dejected with fear.</p>

               <p>Why do tame Sows farrow often, some at one time and others at another, and the Wild but once a year, and all of them about the same time, whence it is said,
<q>The Wild Sow farrowing, that night falls no rain?</q> Is it because through plentiful feeding tame Sows breme oftner? For abundance of nourishment breeds abundance of Seed both in Animals and Plants. Now wild Sows live by their own travel, and that with fear: the tame have always Food enough either by nature, or given them. Or may it not be ascribed to their rest and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise? For the tame do rest, and go not far from their Keepers, the wild get to the Mountains and run about; by which means they waste the nutriment, and consume it upon the whole Body. Therefore either through continual converse, or abundance of Seed, or because the Females feed in Herds with the Males, the tame Sows, call to mind coition and stir up lust, as <hi>Empedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> talks of Men. But in Wild Sows, which feed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, Desire is cold and dull, for want of love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. Or is it true, what <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, that <hi>Homer</hi> Called the Wild Boar <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, because he had but one Stone? For most Boars Spoil their Stones, by rubbing them against Stumps of Trees.</p>
               <p>Why are the Paws of Bears the sweetest and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santest in Food? Because what Parts of the Body do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct aliment the best, the Flesh of those Parts is sweetest. And that concocts best, which transpires most by moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and exercise. But the Bear uses the fore-Feet most in going and running, and managing of things, as it were with hands.</p>
               <p>Why are the steps of Wild Beasts most difficultly traced in Spring time? Whether the Dogs as <hi>Empedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> says, <hi>with Noses find the steps of all Wild Beasts,</hi> while they draw in those <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which the Beasts leave in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46328:143"/> the Ground, and the various smells of Plants and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers lying over the Foot-steps, do in Spring time obscure and confound them, and put the Dogs to a loss at win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them? Therefore about <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> no Man rears any hunting Dogs; because abundance of wild Marjoram flourishes and grows there the Year round, and the perpetual fragrancy of the place destroys the scent of the wild Beasts. There is also a Tale, how <hi>Proserpine,</hi> as she was gathering Flowers thereabout, was ravished by <hi>Pluto,</hi> therefore People revering that place as an <hi>Asylum,</hi> do not catch any Creature that feeds thereabout.</p>
               <p>Why are the tracks of wild Beasts worst scented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Full-moon? Whether for the foresaid cause? For the Full-moons bring down the Dews. Therefore <hi>Alcman</hi> calls Dew the Daughter of <hi>Jove</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> in a Verse of his,
<q>Fed by the Dew, bred by the Moon and <hi>Jove.</hi>
                  </q> For Dew is a weak and languid Rain, and there is a little heat in the Moon, which draws from the Earth, as the Sun does: but because it cannot raise it on high, it soon lets it fall.</p>
               <p>Why does Frost make Hunting difficult? Whether is it, because the wild Beasts leave off going far abroad by reason of the cold, and so leave but few signs of them? Therefore some say, wild Beasts spare the neighbouring places, that they may not be sore put to it by going far abroad in Winter; but may always have Food ready at hand. Or is it because that for Hunting the Track alone is not sufficient, but there must be scent also? And things gently dissolv'd and loosened by heat, afford a smell; but too violent cold binds up the scent and will not let it reach the sense. Therefore they say, that Unguents and Wine smell least in Winter and cold
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46328:144"/> weather: For the then concrete Air keeps the scent in, and suffers it not to disperse.</p>
               <p>What is the reason, that Brutes, when they ail any thing, seek and pursue remedies, and are often cured by the use of them? Dogs eat Grass, to make them vomit: Swine seek Crey-fish, because the eating of them cures the Head-ach: The Tortoise, when he has eaten a Viper, feeds on wild Marjoram: They say, when a Bear has surfeited himself, and his Stomach grows nauseous, he licks up Ants, and by devouring them he is cured. These Creatures know such things neither by experience nor by chance. Whether therefore, as Wax draws the Bee, and carcases the Vulture afar off by the scent; do Crey-fish so draw Swine, wild Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram the Tortoise, and Ants the Bear, by smells and <hi>effluvia</hi> accommodate to their nature, they being promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted altogether by Sense, without any assistance from Reason? Or do not the Temperaments of Bodies create Appetites in Animals, which sometimes create Diseases, producing divers acrimonies, sweetnesses, and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual and absurd qualities, the humors being altered; as is plain in Women with Child, who eat Stones and Earth? therefore skilful Physicians take their Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostick of recovery or death from the Appetites of the Sick: For <hi>Mnasitheus</hi> the Physician says, that in the beginning of a Disease of the Lungs, he that craves Onyons, recovers; and he that craves Figs, dies: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Appetites follow the Temperament, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament follows Diseases. It is therefore probable, that Beasts, which fall not into mortal Diseases, have such a disposition and temper, that by following their temper they light on their remedies.</p>
               <p>Why does Must, if the Vessel stand in the Cold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long sweet? Is it because Concoction is the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which is sweet into Wine? But Cold hinders Concoction, because it is caused by Heat. Or on the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46328:144"/> contrary, the proper taste of the Grape is sweet, and then it is said to be ripe, when the sweetness is equally diffused all over it: But Cold, not suffering the Heat of the Grape to exhale, and keeping it in, conserveth the sweeness of the Grape. And this is the reason, that in a rainy Vintage, Must ferments but little: for fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation proceeds from Heat, which the Cold does check.</p>
               <p>Why, of all wild Beasts, does not the Boar bite the Toil? Is it, because his Teeth stand so far within his Head, that he cannot well come at the Thread? For his Lips, by reason of their thickness and largeness meet close before. Or does he rather rely on his strength, and so rends the Toyls with his Feet? Or does he both use his Feet and Mouth at the same time, with them tearing the Toil, and with this defending himself against the Hunters? His chief refuge is rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wallowing, therefore rather than stand gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Toyl, he rowls often about, and so clears him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, having no occasion for his Teeth.</p>
               <p>What is the reason, that we admire hot Waters (<hi>i. e.</hi> baths) and not cold, since it is plain, that Cold is as much the cause of one sort, as Heat is of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? It is not (as some are of Opinion) that Heat is a Quality, and Cold only a privation of that Quality, and so that an Entity is a Cause, but a Non-entity no Cause. But we do it, because Nature has attributed Admiration to what is rare, and she puts Men upon enquiry how any thing comes to pass, that seldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. You see the high and vast Sky, which with a gentle turn encompasses the Earth, how many Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles it astords by Night, and what Beauty by Day; the Rain-bow, the pleasant Pictures of the Clouds, and the darting of Lightning are all matter of ornament to it and of admiration to us.</p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:46328:145"/>
               <p>Why are rank Vines fruitless, and fat Goats less apt to procreate, nay scarce able to use Coition, by reason of their fatness? Seed is the Superfluity of the Aliment, which is allotted to the Body: now, when either an Animal or a Plant is of a very strong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and grows fat, it is a sign, that all the Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is spent within, and that there is little or no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement; and so the thing is left barren.</p>
               <p>Why does the Vine irrigated with Wine dy, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since Wine comes from the Vine; Is it as baldness happens to great Wine-bibbers, the heat of the Wine evaporating the moisture? It may be when the Vine is outwardly irrigated with Wine, it is as Fire to the Vine, and destroys the nutritive faculty. Or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Wine is obstructive, it gets into the Roots, stops the passages, and so hinders any moisture from coming to the Plant, to make it grow and thrive. Or, it may seem contrary to nature, that that should return into the vine which came out of it: For whatsoever moisture comes from Plants, it can neither nourish nor assimilate, nor be a part of a Plant.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning the first Principle of Cold.</head>
               <byline>Translated out of the <hi>Greek</hi> by <hi>F. Fetherston,</hi> D. D.</byline>
               <p>IS there then, <hi>Phavorinus</hi> any First or Principal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Existence of Cold, as Fire is the Principle of Heat, by the presence and imparting of which all other Things of the same Nature become cold? Or rather is not cold, the Privation of Heat, as they say, Darkness is the Privation of Light, and Rest the Privation of Motion? In regard that Cold seems to be firm and stable, and Heat always in Motion; and for that the Refrigeration of hot things is not caus'd by the Presence of any active Power, but by the Departure of the Heat. For we find the Heat go off in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and then that which remains grows cold. Thus the Vapor which boyling Water sends forth, ceases also when the Heat is gone. Therefore Refrigeration ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the Heat, diminishes the Quantity, while no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing supplies the Place of it. Or what if any Person should question this way of Arguing, as being that which would abolish several manifest Faculties, as being neither Qualities nor Habits, but the Privations of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Qualities? So to make Ponderosity the Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46328:146"/> of Levity; Hardness the Privation of Softness; Black, of White, Bitter of Sweetness? Or else for this Reason, because all Privation is a thing altogether slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish and without Action, as Blindness, Deafness, Silence, and Death: for they are the Departures of Forms, and the utter Defacings of Substances, not Natures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Substances of themselves. But Cold, where-ever it resides, causes no less Passiveness and Alteration in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies than Heat. For many things are congeal'd by Cold, many things thereby condens'd. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is solid in it, and difficult to be mov'd, cannot be said to be sluggish and void of Action, but firm and ponderous, as being supported by its own Strength, which is endu'd with a Power to preserve it in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Station. Wherefore Privation is the Deficiency and Departure of the opposite Power, but many things are subject to be cold, though abounding with Heat within themselves. And there are some things which Cold the more condenses, and consolidates the Hotter they are, as Iron quench'd in Water. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> also affirm, that the Spirit which is in the Bodies of Infants, is quickned by Refrigeration, and changing the Nature of it, turns to a Soul. But this is a thing much to be disputed. Neither is it rational to believe, that Cold, which is the productive Agent in many other Things, can be a Privation: besides, that no Privation is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of more and less. Neither can any Man say, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those that cannot see, that one is more blind then another; or among those that cannot speak, that one is more silent then another; or that any thing is more dead then another, among those things that never had Life. But in cold things, there is Excess and Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to several degrees: little, and not very little, and in a Word, there is both <hi>Intense</hi> and <hi>Remiss,</hi> as well as in hot things. Now then, because the Matter suffers in some things more violently, in others more languidly,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46328:146"/> therefore some things are hotter, somethings colder than others, according to the Nature of the Matter: for there is no Mixture of Habit with Privation. Neither does any Power admit of Privation opposite to it, nor associates with it in the same Subject, but withstands it altogether. Some things also continue hot till they come to be mixt with cold things, as Black with White, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy with Light, and Sowr with Sweet; by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and Harmony of Colours, Sounds, Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Sawces, affording several Tastes and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures grateful to the Sences. But the Opposition of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Habit, is an Antipathy never to be reconcil'd; the Being of the one enforcing the Destruction of the other. Which Destruction, if it fall out seasonably, according to the Opposition of contrary Powers, many Arts make use of, but chiefly Nature, and that too, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Occasions, in the Alterations of the Air, and in all other things, of which the Deity being the Adorner and Dispenser, obtains the Attribute of <hi>Harmonical</hi> and <hi>Musical:</hi> not that those Attributes are given him for the Disposal of <hi>Deep</hi> and <hi>Shrill, Black,</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> so as to make them agree together; but for his governing in the World the Sympathies and Antipathies of Cold and Heat in such a manner as to unite, and separate again, and for reducing both to a decent Order, by taking that which we call the <hi>Overmuch</hi> from both. Then again, we find that there is the same Sence and Feeling of Cold as of Heat. On the other side, Privation is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be seen, heard, or felt, neither is it known to any of the other Sences. For the Object of Sence is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: but where no Substance appears, there we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Privation to be. Which is a Negation of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as Blindness of Sight; Silence, of Voice, and Vacuity, of Corporeal Substance. For there is no Sence or Perception of Vacuity by Feeling; but where there is no Body to be felt, there a Vacuity is imply'd:
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46328:147"/> neither do we hear Silence; but where we do not hear any thing at all, there we imply Silence. Therefore if Cold were a Privation of Hot, there would be no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sensible of Cold, but only where Hot ceas'd to be, there Cold would be imply'd. But in regard that as Heat is perceptible by the Heat and laxative Softness of the Flesh, so Cold is no less perceptible by the Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Condensation of it; it is from thence apparent, that there is some peculiar Original and Fountain of Cold, as well as Hot, consequently the Privation of both Kinds is something single, and simply particular; but in Substances there are several Differences and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies. For Silence is a thing but of one sort; but of Sounds there are great Variety, sometimes molesting, sometimes delightful to the Sence. There are also the same Differences in Colours and Figures, which vary as they occur to the Sences. But that which is not to be felt, is without Colour and void of Quality, can never be distinguished, but is like it self. Is Cold therefore to be numbred among those Privations that never act upon passive Qualities? Rather the contrary, in regard that Pleasures very great and beneficial to our Bodies, arise from cold things, as no less terrible Mischiefs, Pains and Stupefactions on the other side; which the Heat does not always avoid and give way to, but many times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd within the Body, withstands and opposes. Which Contention of theirs is call'd <hi>Quivering</hi> and <hi>Shaking,</hi> at what time, if the Cold overcome the Heat, thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds Numness and Stiffness of the Limbs: but if the Cold be vanquish'd by the Heat, there follows a pleasing warmth and opening of the Skin, which <hi>Homer</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, in Latin <hi>Calefacere,</hi> whence Calefaction or gentle Heating. These things are past dispute, and chiefly by these passive Qualities it is, that we find Cold to be opposite to Heat, as Substance to Substance, or passive Quality to passive Quality, not as
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46328:147"/> Negation or Privation: neither is it the Destruction or Abolishing of Hot, but a Kind of Nature and Power tending to its Destruction. Otherwise we should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt the Winter out of the Seasons, and the North Winds out of the Number of the Winds, as being Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the warmer Seasons, and the Southern Gales not having any proper Original. Now in regard there are four first Bodies in the Universe, which by reason of their Number, their being uncompounded, and their Efficacy are allow'd for the most part to be the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Beginnings of all other, that is to say, Fire and Water, Air and Earth; is there not the same Necessity that there should be as many first and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded qualities? And what are they but Heat and Cold, Drought and Moisture, by Vertue of which it comes to pass that all the Principles act and suffer? Thus, as there are in Grammar Abbreviations and Extensions of Rudiments; In <hi>Musick,</hi> deep and acute Sounds, tho not one of them the Privation of the other, we must leave the dry oppos'd to the moist Principles, and the Hot to the Moist; if we intend to have the Effects answerable to Reason and what is visible in Nature. Unless, as it was the Opinion of the ancient <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> we will not allow either Cold or Hot to be in Substance, but only to be common passive Qualities accompanying the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Matter. For he affirms the Contraction and Condensation of the Matter to be <hi>Cold:</hi> but the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification and Laxation of it (for by that Word he calls it) to be Hot. Whence it may not be improperly said, that a Man breaths Hot and Cold at once. For the Breath grows Cold being compress'd and thicken'd by the Lips; but coming out of the open Mouth, it is hot, as being rarify'd by that Emission. But for this <hi>Aristotle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>me Person of Ignorance: for that when we blow with the Mouth open, we blow hot from our own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but when we blow cold, we do not breath forth the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46328:148"/> Air From our selves, but the Air that is before our Mouths is thrust forward, and lights upon what is next it.</p>
               <p>But if we must grant that both Heat and Cold are Substances, let us proceed a little farther in our Discourse, and enquire what sort of Substances they are, and what is the first Principle and Nature of them.</p>
               <p>They then who affirming that there are certain Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular Figures of equal sides in our Body, tell us also that Shuddering, Trembling and Quivering, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else we suffer of the same Nature, proceed from the Roughness of those Figures, who if they mistake in the Parts, nevertheless derive the Beginning from whence they ought. For we ought to begin the Question, as from <hi>Vesta,</hi> from the Substance of all things. By which it chiefly appears, wherein a Philosopher differs from a Physician, a Husband man, or a Piper. For it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for them to contemplate the remote Causes. For if their nearest Consideration of the Cause of the Affection go no farther, then to find, that the Cause of a Fever is intensness of Heat, or the lighting of some Humor where it ought not to be; that the Cause of Blasting is the scorching Heat of the Sun after Rain; and that the Cause why a Pipe falls, is the Contraction of the Pores of the Wood; it is enough for the Artist to know in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Business. But when a Philosopher for Contemplations Sake, scrutinizes into the Truth, the Knowledge of remote Causes is not the End, but the Beginning of his Proceeding in search of the first and ultimate Causes. Wherefore <hi>Ploto</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> enquiring after the Cause of Heat and Gravity, did not stop at the Consideration of Earth and Fire, but bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things perceptible to Sence, to Beginnings only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible by the Mind, they went on even h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Empedocles, Strato,</hi> and the <hi>Stoicks</hi> plac'd the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of active Qualities.

But first let us consider the Opinions of those already nam'd.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that Fire is both hot and bright, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must be something opposite to Fire which is Cold and Dark: for as Dark is opposite to Light, so is Cold to Hot: besides, that as Dark confounds the Sight, so Cold confounds the Feeling. But Heat diffuses the Sence of Feeling, as Light diffuses the Sence of Seeing. Therefore that which is first dark in Nature, is first cold. Now that the Air is first dark, was not unknown to the Poets: for that they call the Air Darkness.</p>

                  </gap>, or <hi>Ayrie Tartarus;</hi> and when a Man quakes and shivers for Cold, he is said to <hi>Tartarize.</hi> And so much for this.</p>
               <p>But in regard Corruption is the Alteration of those things that are corrupted into that which is contrary to every one of them, let us consider whether it be a true Saying, The Death of Fire is the Generation of Air: For Fire dyes like a living Creature, being quench'd by force, or going out of its own accord. Now Quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes the Alteration of it into Air more conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: for Smoak is a sort of Air, or according to <hi>Pindar,</hi> a fuliginous Vapor of the Air, in opposition to Smoak, otherwise call'd Steam or Exhalation. On the other side, when Fire goes out for want of Fuel, as in Candles, you shall observe a thick and cloudy Air ascending from the Top of them. Moreover, the Vapor steaming from our Bodies, upon the pouring of cold Water after hot Bathing, or Sweating, sufficiently declares the Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of extinguish'd Heat into Air, as being naturally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to Air; whence it follows, that the Air was at first dark and cold. Then again, Congelation, which is the most forcible and violent of all things that befal our Bodies, by reason of Cold, is the Passiveness of Water, but the Action of Air. For Water of it self is easily diffus'd, loose in its Parts, and not readily congeal'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but it is thicken'd and compress'd by the Air, by reason of the Coldness of it. Which is the Reason of the Proverb,
<q>
                     <l>But if the Southern Wind provoke the North,</l>
                     <l>Snow streight will cover all the Earth.</l>
                  </q> For the Southern Wind preparing the Moisture for Matter, presently the North Wind receives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geals it. And this is manifest from the Consideration of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46328:149"/> Snow, which 'ere it falls, you shall observe a thin and sharp cold Air breathing before it. <hi>Aristotle</hi> also tells us, that Whetstones of Lead, will melt and run in the Winter through excess of Freezing Cold, meerly upon the setting of the Water near them: for 'tis probable that the Air compresses and gripes the Bodies so close together, that at length it breaks and crumbles them in pieces. And therefore Water drawn from a Fountain soonest congeals: for the More of Cold in the Air over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Less of Cold in the Water. Thus if a Man takes cold Water out of a Well, and puts it into a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and then lets the Vessel down again into the Well, so that it may not touch the Water, but hang for some time in the Air, the Water will be much colder. Whence it is apparent, that the Coldness of the Water, is not the first Cause of Coldness, but the Coldness of the Air. For you do not find that any of your great Rivers are ever throughly frozen, by reason of their Depth. For the Air does not pierce through the Whole, only so much as it can seize and embrace with its cold Quality, so much generally freezes and no more. Therefore the <hi>Barbarians</hi> never cross over frozen Rivers, till they have sent a Fox before to try the Depth of the Ice. For if the Ice be not very thick, but only superficial, the Fox perceiving it by the Noise of the Water flowing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, returns. And some there are that melt the Ice with hot Water, to make way for their Lines, when they go to catch Fish in Winter. So that nothing suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from Cold in the Depth of the Water. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, so great has been the Alteration of the upper Parts of the Water by Congelation, that several Vessels riding in the Stream, have been bruis'd and broken by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Compressure and Griping of the Congelation; as we have heard from them who lately had their Winter Quarters with <hi>Caesar</hi> upon the <hi>Danaw.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:46328:150"/>
               <p>And indeed what happens to our selves is sufficient to demonstrate the Truth of this. For after hot Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Sweatings we are most sensible of Cold, at what time our Bodies being open, and the Skin relax'd, we give a freer Entrance to the Cold, together with the Ambient Air. And after the very same manner the Water it self suffers. For it sooner freezes if it be first heated, as being thereby rendred more easie for the Air to work upon. And therefore they who lade out fcalding Water, and let it fall again from a good height in the Air, do it to no other purpose then to mix it with a great deal of Air. And therefore <hi>Favorinus,</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that attribute the first Power of Cold to the Air are grounded upon these Probabilities: those that allow it to Water, lean upon Principles of the same Nature. And this was intimated by <hi>Empedocles,</hi> where he says,
<q>
                     <l>Behold the Sun, how warm he is,</l>
                     <l>And brightly shining every where;</l>
                     <l>But Rain and Tempests Black and Dark</l>
                     <l>With Horror fill the Air.</l>
                  </q> And thus opposing Heat to Cold, and Dark to Bright, he gives us to understand, that Black and Cold are both of the same Substance, as also are Bright and Hot. Now that Black is proper to the Water and not to the Air, Sence it self bears witness: Nothing being darkned by the Air, all things being clouded and blacken'd by Water. So that if you throw the whitest Wooll that is, or a white Garment into the Water, it comes out black, and so remains, till the Moisture be dry'd up again by the Heat, or that it be squeez'd forth by Presses or Weights. Also when the ground is water'd, the Places that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Drops grow black, the rest retaining their former Colour. And therefore the deepest Waters, by reason of their Quantity always appear blackest, but the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46328:150"/> Parts, which are next the Air, afford a lovely and smiling Brightness. But of all Liquids, Oyl is the most transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, because of the great Quantity of Air that is in it. And of this, the Lightness of it is an unquestionable Proof; the reason why it swims above all things, as carry'd upward by the Air. Being pour'd forth upon the Waves it will cause Calmness upon the Sea, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is so slippery that the Winds can have no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over it, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> thought, but because the Waves will fall and sink when smitten by any moist Body. And this is also peculiar to Oyl, that it shines and shews it self transparent at the Bottom of the Water, while the Watry Humors are dispiers'd by the Air. For being spurted out of the Mouth into the Sea, not only by those that take Spunges in the Night upon the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Water, but also by those that dive for them to the bottom of the Sea, it will cast a Light in the Water. Water therefore has more of Blackness then the Air, but less of Cold. Oyl therefore partaking more of Air, then most liquid things, is least cold, nor will it easily or suddainly freeze: for the Air which is mixt with it will not suffer the Congelation to grow hard. And therefore, as for Needles, Steel Buckles, and such sort of small Iron and Steel Wares, they never quench them in Water but in Oyl, fearing least the Over-coldness of the Water should make them too brittle. And indeed the Truth is more truly enquir'd into from the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of these Experiments, then those of Colours. For Hayl, Snow and Ice, as they are most transparent, so they are most cold; and Pitch, as it is hotter, so it is blacker and darker then Honey. Which makes me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at those who affirm the Air to be cold, because it is dark and obscure, unless it be because they find others affirming it to be hot, because it is light. For Dark is not so proper and familiar to Cold, as Heavy and Stable. For many things that are void of Heat, partake of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46328:151"/> Splendor and Light, but there is nothing cold that is light, nimble or apt to ascend upward. Even the Clouds themselves while they preserve the Nature of Air, towre a loft in the Sky; but changing into moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture they presently fall down and having admitted coldness, they loose their lightness as well as their heat. And so on the other side, having regain'd their heat, they again return to Motion, their Substance being carry'd upward, as soon as it is chang'd into Air.</p>
               <p>Neither is the Argument produc'd from Corruption true. For nothing that perishes is corrupted into what is opposite, but by what is opposite to it: as Fire extinguish'd by Water changes into Air. And therefore <hi>Eschylus</hi> spake not so much like a <hi>Tragoedian,</hi> as a Philosopher when he said,
<q>The Water curb, that Punishment of Fire.</q> In like manner <hi>Homer</hi> oppos'd in Battle <hi>Vulcan</hi> to the River, and <hi>Apollo</hi> to <hi>Neptune</hi> more like a Philosopher then a Poet or Mythologist. And <hi>Archilochus</hi> spoke not amiss of a Woman whose Thoughts were contrary to her Words, when he said,
<q>
                     <l>She, weaving suttle Trains and slye Fegaries,</l>
                     <l>Fire in one hand, in th' other Water carry's.</l>
                  </q> Among the <hi>Persians</hi> there were several Customs of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of which the chiefest, and that which would admit of no Refusal was, when the Suppliant taking fire in his hand, and entring into a River, threatned if his Supplication were deny'd, to throw the Fire into the Water. But tho his suite were granted him, yet he was punish'd for Threatning, as being against the Law, and contrary Nature. And this is a Vulgar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46328:151"/> in every body's Mouth, <hi>to mix fire with water,</hi> spoken of those that would attempt Impossibilities: to shew that Water is an Enemy to Fire, and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd thereby, is destroy'd and punish'd by it; not by the Air, which upon the change and destruction of it receives and entertains the substance of it. For if that into which the thing destroy'd be contrary to it, much more does Fire seem contrary to Air then Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For Air changes into Water by Condensation: but into Fire, by dissipation: as on the other side Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is destroy'd into Air by Seperation; into Earth, by Condensation. Which in my Opinion happens by reason of the Propriety and near Affinity between both, not from any thing of Contrariety and Hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one to another. Others there are that which way soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they maintain it, spoil the Argument. For it is most irrational to say that Water is congeal'd by the Air, when they never saw the Air congeal'd in their Lives. For Clouds, Fogs and Mists are no Congelations, but Thicknings and Condensations of the Air, moist and full of Vapors: but a dry Air void of moisture never undergoes refrigeration to such a change. For there are some Mountains that never admit of a Cloud, nor Dew, nor Mist, their tops being so high, as to reach into an Air that is pure and void of moisture. Whence it is manifest, that it is the Condensation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency below which contribute that cold and moisture to the Air, which is mix'd with it.</p>
               <p>Now that great Rivers never freeze downward is but consentaneous to reason. For those Parts which are frozen above transmit no Exhalation outward: for that being penn'd up within, and forc'd downward, it affords heat to the moisture at the bottom. A clear demonstration of which is this, that when the Ice is dissolv'd you may observe a steam arising out of the Water upwards in a very great quantity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46328:152"/> the Bodies of living Creatures are warmest withinâ–ª in the Winter, for that the heat is driven inward by the ambient Cold. Now those upward exhalations and ascensions of the Vapors, not only deprive the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their heat but of their coolness: and therefore they that vehemently desire their drink to be cold, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver move the Snow nor the moisture that is press'd out of it: for Motion would deprive them both of the Vertue which is requir'd from them.</p>
               <p>Now that this Vertue is not the Vertue of Air but of Water, a Man may hence collect by reasoning. First it is not probable that the Air which is next the Sky, and touching the fiery Substance is also touch'd by it, should be endu'd with a contrary Vertue: for otherwise it is not possible that the Extremities of the one should touch and be contiguous to the extremities of the other. Nor is it agreeable to reason that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should constitute that which is corrupted next in order to that which corrupts, as if she were not the Author of Community and Harmony, but of Combat and Contention. For she does not make use of things not pure and without mixture, nor of things dissimilar, but such as have alternately a certain Disposition and Order not to advance Privation, but apt to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and co-operate one with another by ordain'd means. And this is the nature of the Air being expanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fire above the Water, contingent and adhering to both, neither hot in it self nor cold, but containing an intermixture and communion of hot and cold, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly intermix'd in her self, and lightly cherishing the contrary Extremities. Therefore the Air is of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual temper in all places; but Winter is not in all Places alike, nor equally cold, but some parts of the habitable World are cold and moist, others hot and dry; not by chance, but because there is but one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of heat and cold. For the greatest part of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:46328:152"/> is hot and without Water. But they that have travell'd <hi>Scythia, Thrace,</hi> and the <hi>Pontic</hi> Regions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them to be full of vast Lakes, and large and deep Rivers. And as for those Regions that lye between both, those parts that joyn upon Lakes and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes are most cold by reason of the Exhalations from the Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Posidonius</hi> therefore affirming the moistness of the Air to be the cause of Cold, has no way disturb'd the probability of our Argument, but rather added to the strength of it, for the Air would not always be the colder, the fresher it is, unless Cold had its Original from Moisture. And therefore <hi>Homer</hi> much more truly shews us the Fountain of Cold, when he says,
<q>A cool Refreshment fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>m the River breath'd.</q> Then again it many times happens that our Sence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us. So that when we feel cold Garments or cold Wool, we believe we feel them to be moist, by reason of the Substance which is common to both, and of their Natures which are coherent and familiar one with another. But in Climates where the Cold is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, it oft-times breaks and cracks both Pots and Vessels whether made of Earth or Brass; none empty, but all full; the cold giving force and might to the Liquor within: which made <hi>Theophrastus</hi> say, that the Air breaks those Vessels making use of the cold as of a Hammer; wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ther more eloquently or more truly spoken, I leave you to judge. For then Vessels full of Pitch or Milk should be more subject to be broken by the Air.</p>
               <p>But Water seems to be cold of it self, and that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitively too: for in respect of the coldness of it, it is opposite to the heat of the Fire, as to drought in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of it's moisture, and to ponderosity in regard of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46328:153"/> the lightness of it. Lastly Fire is altogether of a dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating and dividing Nature: Water, of a Nature to fasten and contain, holding and joyning together by vertue of its moisture. Which was the reason why <hi>Empedocles</hi> call'd Fire a <hi>Pernicious Contention,</hi> but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>Vehement Friendship.</hi> For the Nourishment of Fire is that which changes into Fire, and it changes that which is as it were of Kin and familiar to it. What is contrary to it as Water, cannot be chang'd by it, or at least with great difficulty. True it is, that as for it self, as I may so say, it cannot be burnt, but as for green Wood and wet Straw it overcomes them with much strugling, while the heat and cold contending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by reason of their moisture, and their natural Antipathy produces only a dull flame, clouded with smoak, that makes little progress upon the Materials. Compare these Arguments with theirs and consider 'em well.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Chrysippus</hi> beleiving the Air to be the primitive Cold, because it is dark, makes mention only of those that say the Water lyes at farther distance from the Sky then the Air; and being desirous to give some Answer to them, If so, says he, we may as well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Earth to be primitively cold, because it is the farthest distant from the Sky; rejecting that as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improbable and absurd. But for my part I am of Opinion that there might be many probable and rational Arguments brought for the Earth, beginning with that which <hi>Chrysippus</hi> chiefly makes use of for the Air. Which is thus? <hi>First,</hi> that it is dark. For if he assuming these two Contrarieties and Faculties, believes that the one follows the other of necessity, then there might be produc'd a thousand Oppositions and Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Earth in respect of the Sky, which would of necessity follow upon this which we have mention'd. For it is not to be only oppos'd as heavy to Light, or as
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46328:153"/> that which tends downward to that which moves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or as slow and stable to swift and full of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but as that which is heaviest to that which is lightest; that which is thickest to that which is most thin; or lastly as that which is immoveable of it self, to that which moves spontaneously, and as possessing the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle space, to that which is in a perpetual circular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Would it not be absurd to aver that the opposition of heat to cold is accompany'd with so many such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Contrarieties? But Fire is bright, the Earth is dark; nay the very darkest and most void of Light of all things. The Air first of all participates of Light, is soonest alter'd, and being replenish'd with radiancy disfuses the Splendor of it far and near, and shews it self a vast Body of Light. For the Sun rising, as one of the <hi>Dithyrambie</hi> Authors writes,
<q>
                     <l>â€”Presently fill'd</l>
                     <l>The spacious House of the Air-prancing winds.</l>
                  </q> From thence the descending Air disposes a part of her brightness to the Sea and standing Lakes, and the hidden depths of profound Rivers laugh and smile so far as the Air penetrates into them. Only the Earth of all other Bodies remains without light and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable to the Beams of the Sun and Moon. But it is cherish'd and comforted by them, and suffers a small part of it to be warm'd and foster'd by entrance of the heat. But the solidness of it will not admit the brightness of Light, only the Surface of it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd: But the innermost parts of it are call'd by the Names of <hi>Darkness, Chaos,</hi> and <hi>Hades:</hi> and <hi>Erebus</hi> is nothing else but that same perpetual darkness and horror in the Body of the Earth: besides that the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologists</hi> tell us that Night was the Daughter of the Earth. The <hi>Mathematicians</hi> also shew us the Shadow
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46328:154"/> of the Earth eclipsing the Body of the Sun. For the Air is fill'd with darkness by the Earth, as with Light by the Sun: and that part of the Air which is most void of Light, is that same length of the Night which is caus'd by the Shadow of the Earth. And therefore both Men and Beasts make use of the exterior part of the Air and ramble in the dark, guided only by some footsteps of Light and certain Effluxes of a dim twinkling that are scatter'd through it: but he that keeps house and shuts himself up in his Chamber, as being encompass'd by the Earth, remains altogether blind and without Light. Also the Hides and Horns of Beasts will not admit of Light by reason of their Solidness; but being burnt and shav'd they become transparent, the Air being intermix'd with them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I am of Opinion that the Earth is every where by the Poets said to be black, by reason of the darkness of it, and want of Light. So that the <hi>Antithesis</hi> of Light and Darkness is much more remarkable in reference to the Earth, then in respect of the Air.</p>
               <p>But this is nothing to the Question. For we have shewn that there are many cold things which are bright and transparent, and many hot things which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and dark. But Ponderosity, Stability, Density, and Immutability are Qualities more properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Cold, of none of which the Air partakes, but of all which the Earth has a far greater share then the Water. And yet in all these things Cold by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sense it self, appears to be hard, to cause hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to make resistance. For <hi>Theophrastus</hi> tells us of Fish that have been frozen by extremity of Cold, when they have chanced to bounce ashoar; and that their Bodies have been broken and crumbled to peices like a Vessel of Glass or Potters Clay.</p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:46328:154"/>
               <p>You your self have heard at <hi>Delphos,</hi> how that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Persons ascending to the Top of <hi>Parnassus</hi> to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor the <hi>Thyades</hi> that were overtaken with a violent Storm of Wind and Hail, their Coats were frozen so hard and into a substance so like Wood, that being spread upon the ground they broke and crumbled to peices. It also stiffens the Nerves and deprives the Tongue of Motion, congealing the moist and softer parts of the Body: which being obvious to sight, let us thus consider the Effect.</p>
               <p>Every Faculty, where-ever it prevails, changes into it self whatever it overcomes. Thus whatever is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by heat, is set on fire: that which is vanquish'd by Wind, is chang'd into Air. That which falls into Water, becomes well moisten'd, unless quickly sav'd. Of necessity therefore those things which are violently affected by Cold, must be chang'd into the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Cold. For Freezing is an excess of Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; which Congelation ends in Alteration and Putrefaction, when the Cold prevailing every way, congeales the liquid Substance, and presses forth the Heat: so that the bottom of the Earth is, as it were, a kind of Congelation, and altogether Ice (for there the Cold inhabits simple and unmixt and remov'd hard and rigid at the greatest distance from the Sky) but as for those things which are conspicuous as Rocks and Precipices, <hi>Empedocles</hi> believes them to be thrust forth and supported by the fire that burns in the Bottom of the Earth. Which appears the more, in regard that whereever the Heat is press'd forth and vanishes away, all those things are congeal'd by the Cold; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Congelations are call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Coagmentations or fastnings together:</hi> and the extremeties of many things where Heat fails growing black, make them look like brands when the fire is out. For Cold congeals some
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46328:155"/> things more some things less; more especially such things wherein it is primitively existent. For as if it be the Nature of Hot to render Light, that which is hottest is lightest; if of moist to soften, that which is moistest is softest; so if it be the nature of Cold to congeal, of necessity that which is coldest must be most congeal'd, that is to say the Earth: and that which is most cold must be that which is by nature and primitively cold: which is no more then what is apparent to Sense. For Mud is colder then Water, and Earth being thrown upon Fire puts it out. Your <hi>Smiths</hi> also when their Iron is melted and red hot, strew upon it the dust of Marble, to cool it and stop the running of it too fluidly.

Do we not do it, as being guided by our Senses for coolness sake to the Earth, and thereby acknowledging that to be the seat of primitive Cold. And certainly our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting to live near the Sea in Winter, may be thought to be a kind of flight from the Earth of those that seem to forsake it by reason of the nipping Frosts, and run to encircle themselves with the Air of the Sea for warmths sake: but then again in the Summer by reason of the scorching heat, we desire the Earth born Up-land Air, not because it is cold of its self, but beeause it had its Original and blossom'd from the primitive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cold, and is inbu'd with that power which is in the Earth, as Iron is inbu'd with the Vertue of the Water wherein it is quench'd.

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46328:155"/> Waters we find those are the coldest, that flow upon Gravel and Stones, and fall down from Mountains; and of Well-waters, those which are in the deepest Wells: for with these the exterior Air is no longer mix'd by reason of the depth of the Wells, and the other arise out of the pure and unmixt Earth: like the River that falls from the Mountain <hi>Taenarus,</hi> which they call the Water of <hi>Styx,</hi> rising out of a Rock with a parcimonious Spring, but so cold that no other Vessel except the Hoof of an Ass will hold it; for all other sorts of Vessels it breaks and cracks to peices. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians also tell us that the Nature of all sorts of Earth is binding and restrictive; and they number up several sorts of Metals which are made use of in Physic by reason of their styptic and binding Qualities. For the Element of Earth is neither fit to cut, nor move, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has it any points, neither is it subject to be soften'd or melted; but is firm and stable like a Cube; and therefore it has both ponderosity and coldness, had it but the faculty to thicken and condense moist things: nevertheless it causes tremblings and quiverings in our Bodies by reason of its inequality, and if it get the better by the utter expulsion and extinguishing of the Heat, it occasions a frozen and deadly habit of Body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Earth never consumes by burning, neither does Fire consume it, or prey upon it, but with a very slow and difficult Progress. But the Air many times darts forth flame from its self, and being once set on fire, grows fluid, and flashes out in Lightning. Heat also feeds upon moisture; for it is not the solid part of the Wood, but the moist and oyly part that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible. Which being consum'd, the solid and dry is left behind in the Ashes. Neither do they arrive at their mark, who pretending to burn the Ashes also, sprinkle them with Oyl and Grease; for when the Liquid is consum'd, the earthy part remains, do what they can.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46328:156"/> Therefore, because the Earth is of a Nature not to be mov'd from its Station, unalterable in its Substance, and always abiding in the habitation of the Gods, the Ancients call'd it <hi>Hestia</hi> or <hi>Vesta</hi> from standing, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its Immobility and Concretion, of which Cold is the Bond or Ligament, as <hi>Archelaus</hi> the Philosopher term'd it, which nothing is able to unloosen, or soften, as not being capable of heat and warmth.</p>
               <p>As for those who say they have been sensible of the cold of Air and Water, but never felt the Earth so cold, They consider only the surface of the Earth, which is a mixture of Air, Water, Sun and Heat; a sort of People who deny the Air to be naturally and primitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hot, but either scalding Water, or red hot Iron; because they feel and handle the one, but are not sensible of the pure and celestial Fire; in like manner, neither do they see the Earth which lyes conceal'd at the bottom, thÃ´ that be what is chiefly to be taken for the Earth, separated from all other things. The truth of which is demonstrableâ–ª from several Rocks, which from the Deep send forth a cold Vapor so sharp and vehement that it is hard to be endur'd. They also that desire cool drink, throw small Flint-stones into Water. For it becomes thick and quicker to the taste, through the Cold which is carry'd upward fresh and unmix'd from the Stones.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was the Opinion of the Ancient Philosophers and learned Men, that terrestrial and celestial Things were not to be mix'd together, not so much out of a local Consideration of upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most and lowermost in respect of place, but with a respect to the difference of Faculties, attributing hot and splendent, swift and light to the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Sempiternal Nature, but believing dark, and cold and slow, to be the unhappy Portion of the dead under the Shackles of Corruption. More especially

But being depriv'd of these and only the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Parts remaining, presently cold and stiffness takes place as if heat were naturally existent in every thing else, but only in the Earth. These things, dear <hi>Favori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> compare with what has been said by others; which if they neither come too short of probability, nor too much exceed it, bid all their Opinions farewel, as believing it much more becoming a Philosopher to pause in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Matters, rather then over hastily to side with any one particular Party.</p>

               <head type="sub">Whether Water or Fire be most Useful?</head>
               <byline>Translated out of the <hi>Greek</hi> by the same Hand.</byline>
               <p>WAter, the best of things, but Gold is burning Fire, says <hi>Pindarus.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he positively assigns the second Place to Fire. With whom <hi>Hesiod</hi> agreed, where he says,
<q>First of all <hi>Chaos</hi> Being hadâ€”</q> For most believe that by the Word <hi>Chaos</hi> he meant Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from <hi>Caos</hi> signifying <hi>Diffusion.</hi> But the Ballance of Argument as to this Point seems to be equal. For there are some who will have Fire to be the Principle of all things, and that like <hi>Sperm</hi> it begets all things out of it self, and resolves all things again by Conflagration. Therefore, not to mention the Persons, let us consider the Arguments on both sides, which are to us the most convincing.</p>
               <p>Now then is not that most useful to us, which in all places, and always, and most of all, we stand in need of? Like a Piece of Houshold-stuff, or a Tool, nay, like a
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46328:157"/> Friend that is ready at all Hours and Seasons? But Fire is not always useful; for sometimes it is a Prejudice to us, and we avoid it all we can. But Water is useful, Winter and Summer, to the Healthy and Sick, Night and Day, neither indeed is there any time, but that a Man has need of it. Therefore it is that the Dead are call'd <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantes,</hi> as being without Moisture, and by that means depriv'd of Life: and Man may be without Fire, but never was any Man without Water: besides, that that which was existent from the beginning, and with the first Creation of Man must be thought more useful than what was afterwards invented. From whence it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that Nature bestow'd the one upon us as a thing absolutely necessary: the other Fortune and Art found out for Superfluity of Uses: nor was the time ever known that Man could ever say he never stood in need of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or that it was an Invention of any of the Gods or Heroes: but the Use of Fire was a late Invention of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> at what time Life was without Fire, not without Water. And that this is no Poetical Fiction, is demonstrable from this, that there are many sorts of People, that live without Fire, without Houses, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chimneys, in the open Air. And <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cynic</hi> made no use of Fire; so that after he had swallow'd a raw Fish, <hi>This Hazard,</hi> said he, <hi>do I run for your Sakes;</hi> but without Water no Man ever thought it convenient or possible to live. But why do I confine my Discourse only to the Nature of Men? Seeing there are so many Infinite Sorts of Creatures (the Use of Fire being only known to Man) that live and feed, without Fire, upon Roots, Fruits and Raw Flesh; but without Water, neither Fish, nor Fowl, nor Land Animals can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. For all Beasts that feed upon Flesh, of which there are some, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reports, that never drink, nevertheless support Life and Being meerly by Moisture. So that of necessity, that must be most
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46328:158"/> profitable, without which no sort of Life can subsist or endure.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore make a Step from things that make no use of Fire, to things that we our selves make use of, such are Plants and Fruits; of which some are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther void of Heat, others enjoy it but imperfectly and obscurely. But Moisture causes all things to germinate, increase and bring forth. Why should I stand to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on up Wine, and Oyl, and whatever else we reap, and milk forth, and see before our Eyes? when Wheat it self, which is lookt upon as a dry Nourishment, grows by Alteration, Putrefaction, and Corruption of the moist Matter.</p>
               <p>Then again, that is most useful, which is no way detrimental. Now Fire easily becomes most pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but the Nature of Water is never preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial.</p>
               <p>In the next place, that is most useful which affords the Benefit which it brings with least Expence, and without any Preparation. But the Benefit of Fire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Cost and Materials, and therefore the Rich make more use of it than the Poor; and Princes, then Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons; but Water has that Kindness for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that it freely prostrates its self to all alike, a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit perfect in its self, indigent of nothing, and wanting neither Tools nor Implements.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that which by Augmentation looses the Benefit of it, is of least use. Such is Fire, which like a devouring Beast, ravages all before it, useful rather by Art and skilful Moderation, then of its own Nature. But from Water there is nothing to be fear'd.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that is most useful, which may be joyn'd with another. But Fire will not admit of Water; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it any way profitable by Conjunction with it. But Water becomes profitable by joyning with Fire, and therefore hot Waters are wholesome and sensibly
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46328:158"/> cure several Diseases. Neither shall you ever find moist Fire, but Water both cold and hot, profitable for the Body of Man.</p>
               <p>Then again, there being four Elements, Water pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a fifth out of its self, which is the Sea, no less beneficial then the rest, as well for Commerce, as for many other things. So that it may be said this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment united and perfected our manner of Living, which before was wild and unsociable, correcting it by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Assistance, and creating Community of Friendship by reciprocal Exchanges of one good Turn for another. Therefore said <hi>Heraclitus, If there were no Sun, it would be perpetual Night:</hi> as much as to say, if there were no Sea, Man would be the most savage and shameless of all Creatures. But the Sea brought the Vine into <hi>Greece,</hi> and out of <hi>Greece</hi> transmitted the Use of Corn to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Parts: from <hi>Phoenicia</hi> translated the Knowledge of Letters, the Memorials that prevent Oblivion: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd the World with Wine and Fruit, and prevented the greatest part of Mankind from being Illiterate and void of Education. How is it possible then but that Water should be the most useful, when it thus far exceeds the Element of Fire? Or what can any Man say in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Contrary?</p>
               <p>We say then, the Deity appointed the four Elements to compleat the Fabrick of the Universe: and these again different one from another; only that Earth and Water were subjected, as being made and form'd instead of Materials: and participating of Form and Order, and of Power to procreate and bring forth, so far as they are assisted by Air and Fire, the great Artificers that mould them into various Shapes; and lying dead, till rous'd by them to act and generate; of which two latter, Fire is the ruling Agent; as is manifest by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:46328:159"/>
               <p>For Earth without Warmth and Heat is altogether barren and unfruitful; but Fire, by Vertue of its rows<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inflaming Quality, renders it diffusive and swells it into Generation. Nor can any Man find out any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cause, why Rocks and the dry Tops of Mountains are not productive; but because they participate either nothing at all, or very little of Fire. Then generally for Water, it is so far from being sufficient of it self, for the Generation and Preservation of other things, that it is it self destroy'd for want of Fire. But Fire is that which upholds every thing in its proper Being, and preserves it in its proper Substance, as well Water it self, as all other things; so that when Fire leaves it, Water will stink, and it may be said, that the Want of Fire is the Death and Destruction of Water. And thus we find that Pools and all manner of standing Waters, and such as are setled in Cavities not to be come a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>, what an offensive and dead Stench they send forth, and all for want of Motion; which as it kindles Heat in all things, so more especially in running Waters and swift Streams, which being thus agitated and enliven'd by Heat, we commonly say such Waters <hi>Live.</hi> Why then should not that be accounted the most useful of the two that affords to the other the Cause of its Being, as Fire does to Water? For there is Moisture also in things after they are dead, nor are they altogether dry'd up; for otherwise moist Bodies would never putrifie; since Putrefaction is the Alteration of Dry into Moist, or rather the Corruption of Moisture in Flesh. Neither is Death any other then an absolute Defect and want of Heat: and therefore dead Carkasses are the Coldest of all. So that if you do but touch them with a Razor, they will blunt the Edge of it, through Excess of Coldness. Also in living Creatures, those Parts that least partake of Heat, are most insensible, as the Bones and Hair. And those Parts which are most distant from the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:46328:159"/> Heart: So that the Difference which appears in living Things, is more or less, as their Heat is more or less vigorous. For Plants and Fruits are not produc'd by Moisture, but by the Warmth of the Moisture; and cold Waters are most certainly, either less productive, or altogether barren. For if Water were fruitful in it self, it would always, and that spontaneously too, bear Fruit. But the contrary is apparent, and that it is rather bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to generation from another Principle.</p>
               <p>Now as to the Use of Fire, consider'd as Fire, we have no need of Water, rather the contrary is to be made out: for Water extinguishes Fire. And as for Water, there is no use to be made of it in most things without Fire. For Water heated becomes useful, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwise it is prejudicial. So that of the two that is to be accounted best, which is profitable of it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Assistance of another. Besides that Water is only beneficial to the Feeling, when you either wash with it, or touch it; But Fire is profitable to all the Sences; not only being felt, but seen at a Distance; so that you may add this to the rest of the Vertues of it, that they are manifold and extraordinary.</p>
               <p>Then to say, that Man did once subsist without Fire, is a Mistake, it being impossible that Man should be without it. But we must acknowledge there are Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in this Kind, as well as in other things. Thus Heat has rendred the Sea more beneficial, as having a greater Portion of Heat in it then other Waters, from which it otherwise differs not at all. And as for those that have no need of outward Fire, they do not avoid it because they do not want it, but because they abound in Heat within themselves. So that the Use of Fire seems to be more excellent in this, that Water is never in such a Condition as not to want external Aids; but Fire, endu'd with manifold Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, contents it self with its own Sufficiency. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:46328:160"/> as he is the best Commander, who so manages the Affairs of his City, as not to have any need of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Assistance; so that Element excels, that supplys us in such a mannerâ–ª as to want the least of other Helps from without. And this is to be said of other Creatures that have no need of external Heat.</p>
               <p>Now to argue on the other side, a Man may say thus, that whatever we make use of singly and alone is more profitable, and that is chiefly best, which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be so by our Reason. For what is more useful or beneficial to us than Reason? and yet brute Animals want it. What then? is it the less profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because found out by foresight of its Utility? And since our Discourse has brought us to it, What is more beneficial to Life then Art? Yet Fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and preserves all manner of Arts: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Vulcan</hi> is feign'd to be the Prince of all Artificers.</p>
               <p>Man has allow'd him but a little time to live, and as <hi>Aristo</hi> said, Sleep, like a Toll-gatherer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives him of the one half of that too. But for my Part, my Opinion is, that if a Man should wake all Night in the Dark, he would have no Benefit of his Watchfulness, unless Fire at the same time discover'd to him the Benefit of Light, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd before his Eyes the Difference between Night and Day. Since then there is nothing more beneficial to Man then Life, and that this is prolong'd by Fire, Why should not Fire be accounted the most beneficial of all things?</p>
               <p>Lastly, That is to be thought most profitable, which most apparently communicates to the Sences the Effects of its Temperament. Now do you not find that there is not any of the Sences, which of it self makes use of Moisture, without an Intermixture of Air and Fire? But every Sence partakes of Fire, as being that which
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:46328:160"/> quickens the vital Faculty: more especially the Sight, which is the most acute of all the Sences in the Body, being a certain fiery Efflux, that gave us our first Light into the Belief of a Deity, and by Vertue of which we are able, as <hi>Plato</hi> says, to conform our Souls to the Motions of the Celestial Bodies.</p>

Now to live well is to live sociably, friendly, temperately, and justly: Of all which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they leave us not one, who cry out, that Mans Soveraign Good lies in his Belly, and that they would not
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46328:162"/> purchase all the vertues together at the Expence of a crackt Farthing, if Pleasure were totally and on every side remov'd from them. And in their Discourses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Soul and the Gods, they hold, that the Soul perishes, when it is separated from the Body, and that the Gods concern not themselves in our Affairs. Thus the <hi>Epicureans</hi> reproach the other Philosophers, that by their wisdom they bereave Man of his Life; whilst the others on the contrary accuse them of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men to live degenerately, and like Beasts. Now these things are scatter'd here and there in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and dispers'd thrÃ´ all his Philosophy. But this <hi>Colotes</hi> by having extracted from them certain Pieces and Fragments of Discourses, destitute of any Arguments whatever, to render them credible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, has compos'd his Book, being like a Shop or Cabinet of Monsters and Prodigies: As you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know, than any one else, because you have always in your Hands the Works of the Ancients.</p>
               <p>But he seems to me, like the <hi>Lydian,</hi> to open not only one Gate against himself, but to involve <hi>Epicurus</hi> also in many and those the greatest Doubts and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. For he begins with <hi>Democritus,</hi> who receives of him an excellent and worthy Reward for his Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It being certain, that <hi>Epicurus</hi> for a long time call'd himself a <hi>Democritean,</hi> which as well others affirm, as <hi>Leonteus,</hi> a principal Disciple of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he writ to <hi>Lycophron,</hi> says, that <hi>Epicurus</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor'd <hi>Democritus,</hi> because he first attain'd, thÃ´ a little at a Distance, the right and sound Understanding of the Truth, and that in general all the Treatise concerning natural things was call'd <hi>Democritean,</hi> because <hi>Democritus</hi> was the first, who hapned upon the Principles, and met with the primitive Foundations of Nature. And <hi>Met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46328:163"/> attain'd to Wisdom.</hi> Now if it be true, as <hi>Colotes</hi> holds, that to live according to the Opinions of the other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers is not to live, <hi>Epicurus</hi> was then a Fool in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Democritus,</hi> who led him to a Doctrin, which taught him not to live. Now the first thing, he lays to his Charge, is, that by supposing <hi>every thing to be no more such than such,</hi> he wholly confounds human Life. But <hi>Democritus</hi> was so far from having been of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>Nothing is more such than such,</hi> that he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd <hi>Protagoras</hi> the Philosopher, who asserted it, and writ many excellent Arguments, concluding against him, which this fine Fellow <hi>Colotes</hi> never saw, nor read, nor yet so much as dream'd of; but deceiv'd himself by misunderstanding a Passage, which is in his Works, where he determins, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, and meaning, that the Void has its own proper Nature and Subsistence, as well as the Body.</p>
               <p>But he is of Opinion, that <hi>Nothing is more such than such,</hi> who makes use of a Sentence of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> in which he says, that all the Apprehensions and Imaginations, given us by the Senses, are true. For if of two, saying, the one, that the Wine is sowr, and the other, that 'tis sweet, neither of them shall be deceiv'd in their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how shall the Wine be more sowr than sweet? And we may often see that some Men, using one and the same Bath, find it to be hot, and others, to be cold: Because those order cold Water to be put into it, as these do hot. 'Tis said, that, a certain Lady, going to visit <hi>Berrhonice,</hi> Wife to King <hi>Deiotarus,</hi> assoon as ever they approach'd each other, they both immediatly turn'd their Backs, the one, as it seem'd, not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear the smell of Perfume, nor the other of But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If then the Sense of one is no truer than the Sense of another, 'tis also probable, that Water is no more cold than hot, nor sweet Ointment or Butter, better or worse
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46328:163"/> sented one than the other. For if any one shall say, that it seems the one to one, and the other to another, he will, before he is aware, affirm, that they are both the one and the other. And as for these Symmetries and Proportions of the Pores or little Passages in the Organs of the Senses, about which they talk so much, and those different Mixtures of Seeds, which, they say, being dispers'd thrÃ´ all Savors, Odors, and Colors, move the Senses of different Persons to perceive different Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, do they not manifestly drive them to this, that <hi>Things are no more one than another?</hi> For to pacify those, who think, the Sense is deceiv'd, and lies, because they see contrary Events and Passions in such, as use the same Objects, and to solve this Objection, they teach, that, all things being mixt and confounded together, and yet one nevertheless being more suitable and fitting to one, and another to another, there is not made a Contact and Comprehension of one and the same Quality, nor does the Object equally move all with all its Parts; but every one, meeting only those, to which it has its Sense commensurate and proportion'd, they are too blame so obstinately to insist, that a thing is either color'd or not color'd, white, or not white, thinking to establish their own Senses by destroying those of others: whereas they ought neither to combat the Senses, because they all touch some Quality, each one drawing from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Mixture, as from a living and large Fountain, what is suitable and convenient; nor to pronounce of the whole, by touching only the Parts, nor to think, that all ought to be affected after one and the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, seeing that one is affected by one Quality and Faculty of it, and another by another. Are we then to seek, who those Men are, which bring in this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>Things are not more one than another?</hi> Or are those they, who hold, that every sensible thing is a Mixture, compos'd of all sorts of Qualities, like a Wind-Instrument,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46328:164"/> fitted for all sorts of Tunes? Now they confess, that all their Rules are lost, and their Faculty of judging quite gone, if they admit any sensible Object, that is pure and simple, and do not make each one thing to be many.</p>
               <p>See now to this purpose, what Discourse and Debate <hi>Epicurus</hi> makes <hi>Polyaenus</hi> to have with him in his Banquet concerning the Heat of Wine: for when he askt: <hi>Do you, Ã´</hi> Epicurus <hi>say, that Wine does not heat?</hi> Some one answer'd: <hi>'Tis not universally to be affirm'd, that Wine Heats.</hi> And a little after: <hi>For Wine seems not to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally an Heater; but such a Quantity may be said to heat such a Person.</hi> And again subjoining the Cause, to wit, the Compressions and Disseminations of the <hi>Atoms,</hi> and having alledg'd their Commixtures and Conjunctions with others, when the Wine comes to be mingled in the Body, he adds this Conclusion: <hi>'Tis not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally to be said, that Wine is endu'd with a Faculty of Heating; but that such a Quantity may heat such a Nature, and so dispos'd; but that such a Quantity to such a Nature is cooling. For in such a Mass there are some Natures and Complexions, of which Cold might be compos'd, if it were necessary, that being joyn'd with others, they should yield a refrigerative Vertue. Wherefore some are deceiv'd, who say, that Wine is universally an Heater, and others, that 'tis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally a Cooler.</hi> He then, who says, that many are deceiv'd, and err, in holding that, which is hot, to be heating, and that, which is cold, to be cooling, is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in an Error, if he does not perceive it to follow from his Assertion, that <hi>one thing is not more such than another.</hi> He farther adds afterwards, that oftentimes Wine, entring into a Body, brings with it thither nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a calefying nor refrigerating Vertue, but, the Mass of the Body being agitated and disturb'd, and a Transposition made of the Parts, the Heat-effecting Atoms, being assembled together, do by their Multitude
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:46328:164"/> cause an Heat and Inflammation in the Body; and sometimes on the contrary disassembling themselves, cause a Refrigeration.</p>
               <p>But 'tis yet moreover wholly evident, that he has proceeded so far, as to say, that of all those things, which are call'd and esteem'd Bitter, Sweet, Purging, Dormitive, and Luminous, not any one of them has an entire and perfect Quality to produce such Effects, nor to do, rather than to suffer, when they are in the Bodies, but are there susceptible of various Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures and Differences. For <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that Colors are not connatural to the Body, but are engendred there according to certain Situations and Positions with respect to the Sight of Man, says: <hi>For this Reason the Body is no more color'd, than destitute of Color.</hi> And a little above he writes thus word for word: <hi>But without this Part, I know not, how a Man may say, that those Bodies, which are in the Dark, have Color; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thÃ´ very often, an Air equally dark being spread about them, some distinguish Diversities of Colors, others perceive them not thrÃ´ the Weakness of their Sight: and moreover going into a dark House or Room, we at our first entrance see no Difference of Color, but, after we have stay'd there a while, we do. Wherefore we are to say, that every Body is not more color'd, than not color'd.</hi> Now, if Color is a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and has its Being in regard to something else, so also then is White, and so likewise Blew: and if Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors are so, so also are Sweet and Bitter: so that it may truly be affirm'd of every Quality, that <hi>it is not rather such than such:</hi> For to those, who are in such manner dispos'd, they will be such; but to those, who are not so dispos'd, they will also not be such. <hi>Colotes</hi> therefore has bedash'd and bespatter'd himself and his Mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </q> No indeed; but yet much farther in his second Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension he, without any way minding it, drives <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> out of this Life. For he affirms <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> to have said, that the Atoms are to the Senses Color by a certain Law, or Ordinance, that they are by the same Law Sweetness, and by the same Law Concretion: And that he, who uses this Reason, and persists in this Opinion, cannot himself imagin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is living or dead. I know not how to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this Discourse; but this I can boldly affirm, that this is as inseparable from the Sentences and Doctrins of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> as, they say, Figure and Weight are from Atoms. For what is it, that <hi>Democritus</hi> says? That there are Substances, in Number infinite, call'd <hi>Atoms,</hi> because they cannot be divided, yet different, without any Quality, which move, being dispers'd here and there, in the infinit Voidness, and that when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach one another, or meet; and are conjoin'd, that of such Masses, thus heap'd together, one appears Water, another Fire, another a Plant, another a Man: and that all these are <hi>Atoms</hi> still, call'd by him <hi>Ideas,</hi> or Forms, and that there is nothing else: For there can be no Generation; and of those things, which are, not any one can become Nothing: because, these Atoms are so firm, that they can neither be chang'd, alter, nor suffer. Wherefore there cannot be made Color of those things, which are without Color, nor Nature or Soul of those things, which are without Quality, and impassible. <hi>Democritus</hi> then is to be blam'd, not for confessing those things, that happen upon his Principles,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46328:165"/> but for supposing Principles, upon which such things happen. For he should not have suppos'd immutable Principles; or having suppos'd them, not have seen, that the Generation of all Quality is taken away; but having seen the Absurdity, to deny it is most impudent. But <hi>Epicurus</hi> says, that he supposes the same Principles with <hi>Democritus,</hi> but that he says not, that Color, Sweet, White, and other Qualities are by Law and Ordinance. If therefore not to say is this, does he not confess, that he does something of what he is wont to do? For it is, as when taking away divine Providence, he nevertheless says, that he leaves Piety and Devotion towards the Gods; and when choosing Friendship for the sake of Pleasure, that he suffers most grievous Pains for his Friends; and supposing the Universe to be infinit, that he nevertheless takes not away High and Low. But it is *** Indeed having taken the Cup, one may drink what he pleases, and return the Rest. But in Reasoning one ought chiefly to remember this wise Apophthegm, That of Principles, which are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, the Ends and Consequences are necessary. It was not then necessary for him to suppose, or, to say better, to steal from <hi>Democritus,</hi> that Atoms are the Principles of the Universe; but having suppos'd this Doctrin, and having pleas'd and glorify'd himself in the first probable and specious Appearances of it, he must afterwards also swallow that, which is troublesom in it, or must shew, how Bodies, which have not any Quality, can bring all sorts of Qualities to othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s only by their Meeting and joyning together. As, to take that, which comes next to hand, whence does that, which we call Heat, proceed, and how is it engendred in the <hi>Atoms,</hi> if they neither had Heat, when they came, nor are become hot, after their being join'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? For the one presupposes, that they had some Quality, and the other, that they were sit to receive
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:46328:166"/> it. And you affirm, that neither the one nor the other must be said to agree to <hi>Atoms,</hi> because they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible. How then? Do not <hi>Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Xenocrates</hi> produce Gold from that, which is not Gold, and Stone from that, which is not Stone, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things from the four first simple Bodies? Yes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but with these Bodies immediately concur also the Principles for the Generation of every thing, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them great Contributions, that is, the first Qualities, which are in them: then, when they come to assemble and join in one, the Dry with the Moist, the Cold with the Hot, and the Solid with the Soft, that is, active Bodies with such, as are fit to suffer and receive every Alteration and Change, then is Generation wrought by passing from one Temperature to another, Whereas the Atom, being alone, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd and destitute of all Quality and generative Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and when it comes to meet with the others, it can make only a Noise and Sound, because of its Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Firmness, and not any other Accident. For they always strike and are stricken not being able by this means to compose or make an Animal, a Soul, or a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nay not so much as a Mass or Heap of themselves: for that as they beat upon one another, so they fly back again asunder.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Colotes,</hi> as if he were speaking to some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unletter'd King, again attacks <hi>Empedocles</hi> for breathing forth these Verses:
<q>
                     <l>I've one thing more to say: 'Mongst Mortals there</l>
                     <l>No Nature is, nor that grim thing, Men fear</l>

                     <l>A Mixture, and mixt things asunder burst</l>
                     <l>Again, when them Disunion does befall:</l>
                     <l>And this is that, which Men do Nature call.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:46328:166"/> For my Part, I do not see, how this is repugnant and contrary to Life or Living, especially amongst those, who hold, that there is no Generation of that, which is not, nor Corruption of that, which is; but that the Assembling and Union of the things, which are, is call'd Generation, and their Dissolution and Disunion nam'd Corruption and Death. For that he took Nature for Generation, and that this is his Meaning, he has himself declar'd, when he oppos'd Nature to Death: and, if they neither live, nor can live, who place Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in Union, and Death in Disunion, What else do these <hi>Epicureans?</hi> Yet <hi>Empedocles,</hi> gluing, as it were, and conjoining the Elements together by Heats, Softnesses, and Humidities, gives them in some sort a Mixtion and Unitive Composition; but these Men, who hunt and drive together the <hi>Atoms,</hi> which they affirm to be immutable and impassible, compose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, proceeding from them, but indeed make many and continual Percussions of them.</p>
               <p>For the Interlacement, hindring the Dissolution, more and more augments the Collision, and Concussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so that there is neither Mixtion, nor Adhaesion and Conglutination, but only a Combustion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, which according to them, is call'd Generation. And if the <hi>Atoms</hi> do now recoil by reason of the Shock, they have given, and then return again, after the Blow is past, they are above double the time absent from one another, without either touching or approaching, so as nothing can be made of them, not even so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s a Body without a Soul. But as for Sense, Soul, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and Prudence, there is not any Man, who can in the least conceive or imagin, how 'tis possible, they should be made in a <hi>Veidness</hi> and of <hi>Atoms,</hi> which neither when separate and apart, have any Quality; nor any Passion or Alteration, when they are assembled and join'd together, especially, seeing this their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:46328:167"/> together is not an Incorporation, or Congress, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Mixture, or Coalition, but rather Percussions and Repercussions: so that, according to the Doctrin of these People, Life is taken away, and the Being of an Animal deny'd, since they suppose Principles, void, impassible, and invisible, and such, as cannot admit or receive any Mixture or Incorporation whatever. How then is it, that they admit and allow Nature, Soul, and Living Creature? Even in the same manner, as they do an Oath, Prayer, Sacrifice, and the Adoration of the Gods. Thus as they adore by Word and Mouth, only naming and feigning that, which by their Principles they totally take away, and abolish: so they call that, which is born, Nature, and that, which is engendred, Generation, as those, who ordinarily call the Wood it self, the Framing and Fashioning of the Wood, and the Voices, that accord and sound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Symphony. Whence then came it into his Mind, to object these Words against <hi>Empedocles. Why,</hi> says he, <hi>do we tire our selves in taking such care of our selves, in desiring and longing after certain things, and shunning and avoiding others? For we neither are our selves, nor do we live by making use of others.</hi> But be of good Cheer, my dear and sweet Friend <hi>Colotari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> may one perhaps say to him, there is none, who hinders you from taking Care of your self by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Nature of <hi>Colotes</hi> is nothing else, but <hi>Colotes</hi> himself; or that forbids you to make use of things (now things with you are Pleasures) by shewing, that there is not the Nature of Tarts and Marchpanes, of Sweet Odors, or Venereal Delights; but there are Tarts and Marchpanes, Parfumes, and Women. For neither does the Grammarian, who says, that the Strength of <hi>Hercules</hi> is <hi>Hercules</hi> himself, deny the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Hercules,</hi> nor do those, who say, that Sympho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Opinions are but bare Prolations, affirm, that
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46328:167"/> there are neither Sounds nor Opinions: since also there are some, who, taking away the Soul and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, do not yet seem to take away either Living, or being Prudent.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Epicurus</hi> says, that the Nature of things are Bodies and their Place, do we so comprehend him, as if he meant, that Nature were something else than the things, which are? or as if he insinuated, that it is the things themselves, which are, and nothing else? As, to wit, he is wont to call Voidness it self the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Voidness, and the Universe, by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Nature of the Universe. And if one any should thus que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion him: <hi>What sayst thou,</hi> Epicurus, <hi>that this is Void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that the Nature of Voidness? No by</hi> Jupiter, would he answer: <hi>But this Communication of Names, one for another, is it in use by Law and Custom, or is it not?</hi> I grant, it is. Now what has <hi>Empedocles</hi> done else, but taught, that Nature, is nothing else, save that which is born; and Death no other thing but that which dies? But as the Poets very often, forming as it were an Image, say thus in figurative Language:
<q>
                     <l>Strife, Tumult, Noise, plac'd by some angry God,</l>
                     <l>Mischief, and Malice, there had their Abode;</l>
                  </q> So do many attribute Generation and Corruption to things, that are contracted together and dissolv'd. But so far has he been from stirring, and taking away that, which is, or contradicting that, which evidently appears, that he casts not so much as one single word out of the accustom'd use; but taking away all figurative Fraud, that might hurt or endammage things, he again restor'd the ordinary and usual signification to words in these Verses.</p>

               <p>And yet I my self say, that <hi>Colotes,</hi> thÃ´ he alledg'd these Verses, did not understand, that <hi>Empedocles</hi> took not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Men, Beasts, Trees, or Birds, which he affirm'd to be compos'd of the Elements, mixt together: and that by teaching, how much they are deceiv'd, who call this Composition Nature and Life, and this Dissolution unhappy Destruction and miserable Death, he did not abrogate the using of the customary Expressions in this respect. And to me indeed <hi>Empedocles</hi> seems not to have aim'd in this place at the disturbing the common manner of using and pronouncing these Words; but that he really, as it has been said, had a Controversy about Generation from things, that have no Being, which some call Nature. Which he manifestly shews by these Verses:

For to him, who would not so savagely and foolishly, but more gently calumniate, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verses might give a colorable occasion of charging <hi>Empedocles</hi> with the contrary, when he says:
<q>

                     <l>No prudent Man can e're into his Mind</l>
                     <l>Admit, that, whilst Men, living here on Earth,</l>
                     <l>(Which only Life they call) both Fortunes find,</l>
                     <l>They Being have; but that before the Birth</l>
                     <l>They nothing were, nor shall be, when once dead.</l>
                  </q> For these are not the Expressions of a Man, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies those, that are born, to be, but rather of him, who holds those to be, that are not yet born, or that are already dead. And <hi>Colotes</hi> also does not altogether accuse him of this; but says, that accord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ng to his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion we shall never be sick, never wounded. But how is it possible, that he, who affirms Men to have Being both before their Life and after their Death, and during their Life <hi>to find both Fortunes,</hi> or to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd both by Good and Evil, should not leave them the Power to suffer? Who then are they, Ã´ <hi>Colotes,</hi> that are endu'd with this Privilege, never to be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, never to be sick? Even you your selves, who are compos'd of Atoms and Voidness, neither of which, you say, has any Sense. Now there is no great Hurt in this; but the worst is, You have nothing left, that can cause you Pleasure, seeing an Atom is not capable to receive those things, which are to effect it, and Voidness cannot be affected by them.</p>
               <p>But because <hi>Colotes</hi> would immediatly after <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> seem to inter and bury <hi>Parmenides,</hi> and I have pass'd over, and a little postpon'd his Defence, to bring in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them that of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> as seeming to be more coherent and consequent to the first Reprehensions, let us now return to <hi>Parmenides.</hi> Him then does <hi>Colotes</hi> accuse of having broacht and set abroad certain shameful and villainous Sophistries: and yet by these his Sophisms he has neither rendred Friendship less honorable, nor Voluptuousness or the Desire of Pleasures more auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46328:169"/> and unbridled. He has not taken from Honesty its attractive Property, or its being venerable or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable of it self: nor has he disturb'd the Opinions we ought to have of the Gods. And I do not see, how by his saying, that <hi>All</hi> [or the Universe] is <hi>One,</hi> he hinders or obstructs our Living. For when <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself says, that <hi>All</hi> is infinit, that 'tis neither engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred nor perishable, that it can neither increase nor be diminisht, he speaks of the Universe, as of one only thing. And having in the beginning of his Treatise concerning this Matter said, that the Nature of those things, which have Being, consists of those small indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Bodies, which he calls <hi>Atoms,</hi> and of <hi>Voidness,</hi> he makes a Division as it were of one thing into two Parts: one of which has in reality no Subsistence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as your selves term it, impalpable, void, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal: so that by this means, even with you also <hi>All</hi> comes to be <hi>One,</hi> unless you desire in speaking of <hi>Voidness,</hi> to use Words empty and <hi>void</hi> of Sense, and to combat the Ancients, as if you were fighting against a Shadow.</p>
               <p>But these Atomical Bodies, you will say, are, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> infinit in number, and every thing, which appears to us, is compos'd of them. See now therefore, what Principles of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration you suppose, <hi>Infinity</hi> and <hi>Voidness:</hi> one of which, to wit <hi>Voidness,</hi> is unactive, impassible, and incorporeal; the other, to wit <hi>Infinity,</hi> is disorderly, unreasonable, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving and confounding it self, because it cannot for its Multitude, be contain'd, circumscrib'd, or limited. But <hi>Parmenides</hi> has neither taken away Fire, nor Water, nor Rocks and Precipices, nor yet Cities, as <hi>Colotes</hi> says, which are built and inhabited as well in <hi>Europe</hi> as in <hi>Asia:</hi> since he has both made<note n="*" place="margin">For <gap reason="foreign">

For he has written very largely of the Earth, Heaven, Sun, Moon, and Stars, and has spoken of the Generation of Man, and being, as he was, an ancient Author in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siology, and one, who in writing deliver'd his own, and not anothers Doctrin, he has pass'd over none of the principal things in Nature, of which he has not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly treated. Moreover he, first before all others, even before <hi>Socrates</hi> himself; understood, that in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is one Part, subject to Opinion, and another subject to Intelligence. As for that, which is <hi>Opina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> or subject to Opinion, it is always unconstant, wandring, and carry'd away with several Passions and Changes, liable to Diminution and Increase, and to be variously dispos'd, not always after one manner, nor to the same. But as to the <hi>Intelligible</hi> Part, it is quite of another kind,
<q>Constant, entire, and still ingenerable,</q> as himself says, always like to it self, and perdurable in its Being.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Colotes,</hi> Sycophant-like, catching at his Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and drawing the Discourse from Things to Words, flatly affirms, that <hi>Parmenides</hi> in one word takes away and subverts all things by supposing <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>That, which is,</hi> to be <hi>One.</hi> But on contrary he takes away neither the one nor the other Part of Nature; but ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to each of them, what belongs to it, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for it, places the <hi>Intelligible</hi> in the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>One</hi> and of <hi>That, which is:</hi> calling it <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>That, which is,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is eternal and incorruptible; and <hi>One,</hi> because it is always like it self, and admits no Diversity. And as for that Part, which is <hi>Sensible,</hi> he places it in the Rank of Uncertain, Disorderly, and always Moving:
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46328:170"/> Of which two Parts we may see the distinct Judgment in the Soul:
<q>One certain Truth and sincere Knowledge is,</q> as regarding that, which is intelligible, and always alike and of the same sort.</p>

                  <l>The other does on Mens Opinions rest,</l>

               </q>
               <p>Because it is conversant in things, which receive all sorts of Changes, Passions, and Inequalities. Now how he could have left <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Opinion,</hi> if he had not also left <hi>Sensible</hi> and <hi>Opinable,</hi> 'tis impossible for any Man to say.

               <p>But first let us contemplate a little the Diligence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the manifold and profound Knowledge of this our Philosopher, who says, that <hi>Aristotle, Xenocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Theophrastus,</hi> and all the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> have follow'd these Doctrins of <hi>Plato.</hi> For in what Corner of the uninhabitable World<note n="*" place="margin">For <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46328:170"/> Book, that, composing all these Accusations against such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages, you should never have lighted upon their Works, nor have taken into your Hands the Books of <hi>Aristotle</hi> concerning <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>the Soul,</hi> nor those of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> against the <hi>Naturalists,</hi> nor the <hi>Zoroastres</hi> of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> nor his Book of <hi>Hell,</hi> nor that of <hi>Natural Doubts and Difficulties,</hi> nor the Books of <hi>Dicaearchus</hi> concerning <hi>the Soul:</hi> in all which Books they are in the highest degree contradictory and repugnant to <hi>Plato</hi> about the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and greatest Points of Natural Philosophy? Nay <hi>Strato</hi> himself, the very Head and Prince of the other <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> agrees not in many things with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and holds Opinions, altogether contrary to <hi>Plato,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Motion, the Understanding, the Soul, and Generation. In fine, he says, that the World is not an Animal, and that what is according to Nature, follows what is according to Fortune: for that Chance gave the Beginning, and so every one of the Natural Effects was afterwards finisht.</p>
               <p>Now as to the <hi>Ideas,</hi> for which he quarrels with <hi>Plato, Aristotle,</hi> by moving this matter at every turn, and alledging all manner of Doubts concerning them, in his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> in his <hi>Physicks;</hi> and in his <hi>Exoterical Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi> seems to some rather obstinately, than philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically, to have disputed against these Doctrins, as having propos'd to himself the Debasing and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philosophy: so far he was from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it. What an impudent Rashness then is this, that having neither seen nor understood, what these Persons have written, and what were their Opinions, he should go and devise such things, as they never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, and perswading himself, that he reprehends and refutes others, he should produce a Proof, written with his own hand, arguing and convincing himself of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Licentiousness, and shameful Impudence, in saying, that those, who contradict <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46328:171"/> him, and that those, who oppose him, follow him? <hi>Plato,</hi> says he, writes, that Horses are in vain by us esteem'd Horses, and likewise Men. And in which of <hi>Plato's</hi> Commentaries has he found this hidden? For as to us we read in all his Books, that Horses are Horses, that Men are Men, and that Fire is by him esteem'd Fire, because he holds, that every one of these things is sensible and subject to Opinion. But this fine fellow <hi>Colotes,</hi> in whom there is not the least Grain of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, apprehends it to be one and the same thing, to say, Man is not, and Man is a <hi>Non-ens,</hi> or <hi>That, which has no Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to <hi>Plato</hi> there seems to be a wonderful great Difference between <hi>Not to be at all,</hi> and To be a <hi>Non-ens,</hi> or <hi>That, which has no Being:</hi> because the first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports an Annihilation and Abolishment of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and the other shews the Diversity, there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that, which is participated, and that, which participates. Which Diversity those, who are come after, have only distinguisht into the Difference of <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> and certain common and proper Qualities or Accidents, as they are c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ll'd, but ascended no higher, falling into more logical Doubts and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. Now there is the same Proportion between that, which is participated, and that, which partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates, as there is between the Cause and the Matter, the Original and the Image, the Faculty and the Passion. Wherein that, which is by it self, and always the same, principally differs from that, which is by another, and never in one and the same manner: because the one never was, nor ever shall be non-existent, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore totally and essentially an <hi>Ens</hi> or a <hi>Thing, that has Being;</hi> but the other has not that very Being, which it has not of it self, but happens to take and participate from another, firm and constant, but goes out of it by its Imbecillity, the Matter always gliding and sliding about
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46328:171"/> the Form, and receiving several Passions and Changes towards the Image of the Substance, so that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually moving and shaking. As therefore he, who says, that the Image of <hi>Plato</hi> is not <hi>Plato,</hi> takes not away the Sense and Subsistence of the Image, but shews the Difference of that, which is something of it self, from that, which is in regard of it: so neither do they take away the Nature, Use, or Sense of Men, who affirm, that every one of us is by participating the <hi>Idea</hi> of a certain common Substance become the Image of that, which affords Similitude to our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. For neither does he, who says, that a red-hot Iron is not Fire, or the Moon the Sun, but, as <hi>Parmenides</hi> has it,
<q>
                     <l>A Torch, which round the Earth by Night</l>
                     <l>Does bear about a borrow'd Light,</l>
                  </q> take away therefore the Use of Iron, or the Nature of the Moon. But if he should deny it to be a Body, or affirm, that it is not illuminated, he would then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Senses, as one, who admitted neither Body, Animal, Generation, nor Sense. But he, who by his Opinion imagin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>, that these things subsist only by Participation, and how far remote and distant they are from that, which always is, and which communicates to them their Being, does not reject the <hi>Sensible,</hi> but affirms, that the <hi>Intelligible</hi> is: nor does he take away and abolish the Passions, which are wrought, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in us; but shews to those, who follow him, that there are other things, firmer and more stable than these in respect of their Essence, because they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engendred, nor perish, nor suffer any thing, and, more purely touching the Difference, teaches to express it by the Names, calling these <hi>Entia,</hi> or <hi>Things, that have Being;</hi> and those <hi>Fientia,</hi> or <hi>Things engendred.</hi> And
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46328:172"/> the same also usually befals the Moderns: for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive many and those great things of the Appellation of <hi>Ens</hi> or Being: such as are Voidness, Time, Place, and simply the whole entire <hi>Genus</hi> of things spoken, in which are compris'd all things true. For these things, they say, are not <hi>Entia,</hi> but somethings and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually make use of them in their Philosophy, as of things having Subsistence and Existence.</p>
               <p>But I would willingly ask this our Fault-finder, whether themselves do not in their Affairs perceive this Difference, by which some things are permanent and immutable in their Substances, as they say of their Atoms, that they are at all times and continually after one and the same manner because of their Impassibility and Hardness; but that the things, compounded of them, are fluxible, changeable, breeding, and perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: forasmuch as infinit Images are always departing and going from them; and infinit others, as 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, repair to them from the ambient Air, filling up, what was diminisht from the Mass, which is much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versify'd and transvasated, as it were, by this Change, since those Atoms, which are in the very Bottom of the said Mass, can never cease stirring and reciprocally beating upon one another, as they themselves affirm. There is then in things such a Diversity of Substance. But <hi>Epicurus</hi> is in this wiser and more learned than <hi>Plato,</hi> that he calls them all equally <hi>Entia,</hi> or <hi>Things, that have Being,</hi> to wit, the impalpable Voidness, the solid and resisting Body, the Principles, and the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of them: and yet thinks, that the Eternal does not so much as participate of the common Substance with that, which is generated, the immortal with the Corruptible, and the Natures, that are impassible, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durable, unchangeable, and can never fall from their Being, with those, which have their Essence in suffering and changing, and can never continue in one and the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46328:172"/> same State. But thÃ´ <hi>Plato</hi> had with all the Justness imaginable deserv'd to have been condemn'd for having offended in this, yet should he have been sentenc'd by these Gentlemen, who speak more elegantly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, only as having confounded the Terms, and us'd improper Expressions; and not as having taken away the things, and driven Life from us, because he nam'd them <hi>Fientia,</hi> or <hi>Things engendred,</hi> and not <hi>Entia,</hi> or <hi>Things, that have Being,</hi> as these Men do.</p>
               <p>But because we have pass'd over <hi>Socrates,</hi> who should have come next after <hi>Parmenides,</hi> we must now turn back our Discourse to him. Him therefore has <hi>Colotes</hi> begun at the very first to remove, as the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb has it, from the sacred Line, and having mention'd, how <hi>Chaerephon</hi> brought from <hi>Delphos</hi> an Oracle, well known to us all, concerning <hi>Socrates,</hi> he says thus: <hi>Now as to this Naration of</hi> Chaerephons, <hi>because it is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, full of Æ²ntruth, and sophistical, we will over-pass it. Plato</hi> then, that I may say nothing of others, is also odious, who has committed it to writing; and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi> are yet more odious, who reserve that of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> amongst their most ancient and most authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Inscriptions. The Oracle also of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> by which he perswaded the <hi>Athenians</hi> to quit their Town, and in a Naval Fight defeated the barbarous <hi>Xerxes,</hi> was a sophistical Fiction. Odious also were all the ancient Legislators and Founders of <hi>Greece,</hi> who establisht the most part of their Temples, Sacrifices, and solemn Festivals by the answer of the <hi>Pythian</hi> Oracle. But if the Oracle, brought from <hi>Delphos</hi> concerning <hi>Socrates,</hi> a Man ravish'd with a divine Zeal to Vertue, by which he is stil'd and declar'd Wise, is odious, fictitious, and sophistical, by what Name shall we call your Cries, Noises, and Shouts, your Applauses, Adorations and Canonizations, with which you extoll and celebrate him, who incites and exhorts you to frequent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:46328:173"/> Pleasures? For thus has he written in his Epistle to <hi>Anaxarchus: I for my part incite and call you to continual Pleasures, and not to vain and empty Vertues, which have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but turbulent Hopes of uncertain Fruits.</hi> And yet <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> writing to <hi>Timarchus,</hi> says: <hi>Let us do some extraordinarily excellent thing, not suffering our selves to be plung'd in reciprocal Affections, but retiring from this low, and terrestrial Life, and elevating our selves to the truly, holy and divinely reveal'd Ceremonies and Mysteries of</hi> Epicurus. And even <hi>Colotes</hi> himself, hearing one day <hi>Epicurus,</hi> as he was discoursing of natural things, fell suddenly at his Feet, and embrac'd his Knees, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in it, thus writes: <hi>For as if you had ador'd, what we were then saying, you were suddenly taken with a Desire, proceeding not from any natural Cause, to come to us, prostrate your self on the Ground, embrace our Knees, and use all those Gestures to us, which are ordinarily practic'd by those, who adore and pray to the Gods: so that you made us also,</hi> says he, <hi>reciprocally sanctify and adore you.</hi> Those, by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> well deserve to be pardon'd, who say, they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly give any Money for a Picture, in which should be represented to the life this fine story of one, lying prostrate at the Knees, and embracing the Legs of another, who mutually again adores him, and makes his devout Prayers to him. Nevertheless this devout Service, how well soever it was order'd and compos'd by <hi>Colotes,</hi> receiv'd not the condign Fruit, he expected: for he was not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd and compos'd by <hi>Colotes,</hi> receiv'd not the condign Fruit, he expected: for he was not declar'd wise; but it was only said to him: <hi>Go thy ways, and walk immortal, and understand, that we also are in like manner immortal.</hi> These Men, knowing well in their Consciences, that they have us'd such foolish Speeches, have had such Motions, and such Passions, dare nevertheless call o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers odious. And <hi>Colotes,</hi> truly having shewn us these fine First-fruits, and wise Positions touching the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46328:173"/> Senses, That we eat Meat, and not Hay or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and that when Rivers are deep and great, we pass them in Boats, but when shallow and easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, on foot, cries out: <hi>You use vain and arrogant Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Ã´</hi> Socrates: <hi>You say one thing to those, who come to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with you, and practice another.</hi> Now I would fain know, what these vain and arrogant Speeches of <hi>Socrates</hi> were, since he ordinarily said, that he knew nothing, that he was always learning, and that he went enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and searching after the Truth. But if, <hi>Ã´ Colotes,</hi> you had hapned on such Expressions of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as are those, which <hi>Epicurus</hi> writ to <hi>Idomeneus: Send me then the First-fruits for the Entertainment of our sacred Body, for our self and for our Children: for so it comes upon me to speak:</hi> what more arrogant and insolent Words could you have us'd? And yet that <hi>Socrates</hi> spake otherwise, than he liv'd, you have wonderful Proofs in his Gests at <hi>Delium,</hi> at <hi>Potidaea,</hi> in his Behavior during the time of the thirty Tyrants, towards <hi>Archelaus,</hi> towards the People of <hi>Athens,</hi> in his Poverty, and in his Death. For are not these things beseeming and answerable to the Doctrin of <hi>Socrates?</hi> They would indeed, good Sir, have been indubitable Testimonies, to shew, that he acted otherwise, than he taught, if, having propos'd Pleasure for the End of Life, he had led such a Life, as this. Thus much for the Calumnies, he has utter'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Socrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Colotes</hi> besides perceives not, that he is himself found stain'd with the same Crime of Impiety, he objects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Socrates.</hi> For this is one of the Sentences and Propositions of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> That none, but the wise Man, ought irrevocably and unchangeably to be perswaded of any thing. Since then <hi>Colotes,</hi> even after those Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, he perform'd to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> became not one of the Sages, let him first make these Questions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories his own: How is it, that being hungry,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46328:174"/> he eats Meat, and not Hay, and that he puts a Robe about his Body, and not about a Pillar, since he is not indubitably perswaded, either that a Robe is a Robe, or that Meat is Meat? But if he not only does these things, but also passes not over Rivers, when they are great and high, on foot, and flies from Wolves and Serpents, not being irrevocably perswaded, that any of these things is such, as it seems, but doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, according to what appears to him: the Opinion of <hi>Socrates</hi> concerning the Senses was then no Obstacle to him, but that he might in like manner make use of things, as they appear'd to him. For neither did Bread appear Bread, nor Hay appear Hay to <hi>Colotes,</hi> because he had read those holy Rules of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which came down from Heaven; nor yet did <hi>Socrates</hi> thrÃ´ his vanity take a Fancy, that Hay was Bread, and Bread Hay: for these wise Men use better Opinions and Reasons, than we. But to have Sense, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Impression in the Imagination of things, as they appear, is common as well to the ignorant, as to the wise, as proceeding from Causes, where there needs not the Discourse of Reason. And the Proposition, which affirms, that the natural Senses are not perfect, nor certain enough to cause an entire Belief, hinders not, that every thing may appear to us; but leaving us to make use of our Senses in our Actions according to that, which appears, permits us not so to give Credit to them, as if they were exactly true, and without Error: for 'tis sufficient, that in what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and commodious for use, there is nothing better. But as for the Science both of Knowledge, and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Soul of a Philosopher desires to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning every thing, the Senses have it not. But as to this <hi>Colotes</hi> will farther give us occasion to speak of it hereafter, for he brings this Objection against several others.</p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:46328:174"/>
               <p>Furthermore, whereas he profusely derides and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spises <hi>Socrates</hi> for asking, what Man is, and in a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bravery, as he terms it, affirming, that he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it: 'tis manifest, that he himself who scoffs at it, never so much as thought of this matter; but <hi>Heraclitus</hi> on the contrary, as having done some great and worthy thing, said: <hi>I have been seeking my self.</hi> And of the Sentences, that were written over the Gates of <hi>Apollo's</hi> Temple at <hi>Delphos,</hi> the most excellent and most divine seems to have been this: <hi>Know thy self.</hi> And this it was, which gave <hi>Socrates</hi> an Occasion and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of doubting and enquiring into it, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> says in his <hi>Platonicks.</hi> And yet this appears to <hi>Colotes</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and fit to be scofft at: and I wonder, that he derides not also his Master himself, who does as much, whenever he writes concerning the Substance of the Soul, and the Beginning of that confused Mass. For if that, which is compounded of both, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves hold, of the Body, to wit, and the Soul, is Man, he, who searches into the Nature of the Soul, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently also searches into the Nature of Man, beginning from his chiefest Principle. Now that the Soul is very difficultly to be comprehended by Reason, and altogether incomprehensible by the exterior Senses, let us not learn from <hi>Socrates,</hi> who is a vain glorious and sophistical Disputer, but let us take it from these wise Men, who, having forg'd and fram'd the Substance of the Soul, as far as to her Faculties about the Flesh, by which she gives Heat, Softness, and Strength to the Body, of somewhat hot, spiritual, and aÃ«rial, proceeed not to that, which is the principal, but give over faint and tir'd by the way. For that, by which she judges, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, loves, hates, and in a word that, which is prudent and rational, is, say they, made afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> of I know not what nameless Quality. Now we well know, that this nameless thing is a Confession of their
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:46328:175"/> shameful Ignorance, whilst they pretend, they cannot name, what they are not able to understand or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. But let this, as they say, be pardon'd them: for it seems not to be a light and easy Matter, and which every one can at the first Attempt find out and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to, but has retir'd it self to the Bottom of some very remote Place, and there lies obscurely conceal'd: so that there is not amongst so many Words and Terms, as are in use, any one, that can explain or shew it. <hi>Socrates</hi> therefore was not a Fool or Blockhead for seeking and searching, what himself was; but they are rather to be thought shallow Cox-Combs, who enquire after any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing before this, the Knowledge of which is so necessary, and so hard to find. But granting a little to <hi>Colotes,</hi> that there is nothing so vain, useless, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, as the seeking into ones self, let us ask him, what Confusion of human Life is in this, and how it is, that a Man cannot continue to live, when he comes once thus to reason and discourse in himself: <hi>Go to now, what am I? Am I a Composition, made up of Soul and Body, or rather a Soul, serving it self and making use of the Body, as an Horse-man, who, using his Horse, is not a Subject, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of Horse and Man? Or is every one of us the principal Part of the Soul, by which we understand, discourse, and act, and all the other Parts both of Soul and Body, only Organs and Æ²tensils of this Power? Or, to conclude, is there no proper Substance of the Soul at all apart, but only the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature and Complexion of the Body so dispos'd, that it has Force and Power to understand and live?</hi> But <hi>Soceates</hi> does not by their Questions overthrow human Life, since all natural Philosophers treat of the same Matter. But those perhaps are the monstrous Questions and Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that trouble the Common-weal, and turn it upside down, which are in <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> where he says, that every one ought to examin and consider himself, whether he is a savage Beast, more cautelous, outragious, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:46328:175"/> than ever was the Serpent <hi>Typhon;</hi> or on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, an Animal more mild and gentle, partaking by Nature of a certain divine Portion, and such, as is free from Pride. Now by these Discourses and Reasonings he overturns not the Life of Man, but drives from it Presumption and Arrogance, and those haughty and extravagant Opinions and Conceits, he has of himself: for this is that Serpent <hi>Typhon,</hi> which your Teacher and Master has made to be so great in you by his warring against the Gods and divine Men.</p>
               <p>Having done with <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> he next attacks <hi>Stilpo.</hi> Now as for those his true Doctrins and good Discourses, by which he manag'd and govern'd himself, his Country, his Friends, and such Kings and Princes, as lov'd him, and esteem'd him, he has not written a Word; nor yet what Prudence and Magnanimity was in his heart, accompany'd with Meekness, Moderation, and Modesty: But having made mention of one of those little Sentences, he was wont in Mirth and Raillery to object against the Sophisters, he does, without alledging any Reason against it, or solving the Subtilty of the Objection, stir up a terrible Tragedy against <hi>Stilpo,</hi> saying, that the Life of Man is subverted by him, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he affirms, that one thing cannot be predicated of another. <hi>For how,</hi> says he, <hi>shall we live, if we cannot stile a Man good, nor a Man a Captain, but must separately name a Man a Man, Good Good, and a Captain a Captain; nor can say, ten thousand Horse-men, or a fortify'd Town, but only call Horse-men Horse-men, and ten thousand ten thousand, and so of the rest?</hi> Now what Man ever was there, that liv'd the worse for this? Or who is there, that, hearing this Discourse, does not immediately perceive and understand it to be the Speech of a Man, who raillies gallantlyâ–ª and proposes to others this Logical Question for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Wits? 'Tis not, <hi>Ã´ Colotes,</hi> a great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Scandal to say, that Man is not good, or that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46328:176"/> Horse-men are not ten thousand; but to affirm, that God is not God, as you and the rest do, who will not confess, that there is a <hi>Jupiter</hi> presiding over Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a <hi>Ceres</hi> giving Laws, or a <hi>Neptune</hi> watering the Plants. 'Tis this Separation of Names, that is pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and fills our Life with Audaciousness, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical Contempt of the Gods. When you pluck from the Gods the Names and Appellations, that are ty'd to them, you abolish also the Sacrifices, Mysteries, Processions and Feasts. For to whom shall we offer the Sacrifices preceding the Tilling of the Ground, call'd <hi>Proteleia?</hi> to whom those for the obtaining of Health and Preservation, call'd <hi>Soteria?</hi> How shall we celebrate the <hi>Phosphoria</hi> or Funeral Rites, the <hi>Bacchanals,</hi> and the Ceremonies, that go before Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, if we admit neither<note n="*" place="margin">The Priests of <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
                  </note>

                  <hi>Soteres?</hi> For this it is, that touches the principal and greatest Points, being an Error in things, and not in Words, in the Structure of Propositions, or Use of Terms.</p>
               <p>Now if these are the things, that disturb and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert human Life, who are there that more offend and fail in Language than you? For saying, that Propositions are the only Substance of Speech, you utterly abolish the Being of simple Words, and admitting only, what is by Composition, you take away in the mean time the things, particularly signify'd by them, by which are wrought Disciplines, Doctrines, Anticipations, Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Inclinations, and Assents, which you hold to be nothing at all. But as for <hi>Stilpo,</hi> thus the Matter stands.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46328:176"/> If of a Man we predicate Good, and of an Horse Running, he says, that the <hi>Predicate,</hi> or thing predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is not the same with the Subject, or that, of which it is predicated; but that the essential Definition of Man is one, and of Good another; and again, that to be an Horse, differs from to be Running: For being askt the Definition of the one and of the other, we do not give the same for them both; and that therefore those err, who predicate the one of the other. For if Good is the same with Man, and To run the same with an Horse, how is Good affirm'd also of Food and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin; and again, by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> To run, of a Lion and a Dog? But if the <hi>Predicate</hi> is different, then we do not rightly say, that a Man is good, and an Horse runs. Now if <hi>Stilpo</hi> is in this exorbitant, and grosly mistaken, not admitting any Copulation of such things, as are in the <hi>Subject,</hi> or affirm'd of the <hi>Subject,</hi> with the <hi>Subject</hi> it self; but holding, that every one of them, if it is not absolutely one and the same thing with that, to which it happens, or of which it is spoken, ought not to be spoken or affirm'd of it, no not even as an Accident: 'tis nevertheless manifest, that he was only offended with some Words, and oppos'd the usual and accustom'd Manner of Speaking, and not that he overthrew Mans Life, and turn'd his Affairs upside down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Colotes</hi> then, having got rid of the old Philosophers, turns to those of his own time, but without naming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them; thÃ´ he would have done better, either to have reprov'd by Name these Moderns, as he did the Antients, or else to have nam'd neither of them. But he who has so often employ'd his Pen against <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Parmenides,</hi> evidently demonstrates, that 'tis thrÃ´ Cowardise, he dares not attack the Living, and not for any Modesty or Reverence, of which he shew'd not the least Sign to those, who were far more excellent than these: But his Meaning is, as I suspect, to assault
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46328:177"/> the <hi>Cyrenaicks</hi> first, and afterwards the <hi>Academicks,</hi> who are Followers of <hi>Arcesilaus:</hi> for these were they who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all things; but those, placing the Passions and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations in themselves, were of Opinion, that the Belief, proceeding from them, is not sufficient for the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring and affirming of things; but, as if it were in the Siege of a Town, abandoning, what is without, they have shut themselves up in the Passions, using this Word, <hi>It seems,</hi> and not asserting of things without, <hi>It is.</hi> And therefore they cannot, as <hi>Colotes</hi> says of them, live, or have the Use of things. And then speaking comically of them, he adds: <hi>These deny, that there is a Man, an Horse, a Wall; but say, that they become Walls, Horses, Men.</hi> In which he first maliciously abuses the Terms, as Calumniators are usually wont to do. For thÃ´ these things follow from the Sayings of the <hi>Cyrenaicks;</hi> yet he ought to have declar'd the Fact, as they themselves teach it: for they affirm, that things then become sweet, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lightsome, or dark, when each thing has the Effect of these Passions in it self, so that it cannot be distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it. But if Honey is said to be sweet, an Olive-branch bitter, Hail cold, Wine hot, and the Nocturnal Air dark, there are many Beasts things, and Men, that testifie the contrary: for some have an Aversion for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, others feed on the Branches of the Olive-Tree; some are scorcht by Hail, others cool'd with Wine; and some, whose Sight is dazled in the Sun, see well by Night. Wherefore Opinion, containing it self within these Passions, remains safe and free from Error; but when it goes forth, and attempts to be curious in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pronouncing concerning exterior things, It often deceives it self, and opposes others, who from the same Objects receive contrary Passions, and different Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And <hi>Colotes</hi> seems properly to resemble those young Children, who are but beginning to learn their Letters: for being accustom'd to learn them, where
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:46328:177"/> they see them in their own Horn-Books and Primers, when they see 'em written any where else, they doubt and are troubled: so those very Discourses, which he praises and approves in the Writings of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther understands, nor knows again, when they are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by others. For those, who say, that the Sence is truly inform'd and moulded, when there is presented one Image round, and another broken, but nevertheless permit us not to pronounce, that the Tower is round, and the Oar broken, confirm, that the Passions are their Imaginations, but they will not acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that the things without are so affected. But as those say not, that they are an Horse or Wall, but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are imprinted with the Figure of an Horse, or of a Wall: so also it is necessary to say, that the Sight is imprinted with a Figure round or triangular, with three unequal Sides, and not that the Tower is in that manner triangular or round: For the Image, by which the Sight is affected, is broken; but the Oar, whence that Image proceeds, is not broken. Since then there is a Difference between the Passions and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Subject, the Belief must either remain in the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or else the Being, that is confirm'd by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, is reprov'd and convinc'd of Untruth. And whereas they cry out, and are offended about the Sense, because the <hi>Cyrenaicks</hi> say not, that the thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out is hot, but that the Passion of the Sense is such: is it not the same, with what is said touching the Taste, when he says, that the thing without is not sweet; but that some Passion and Motion about the Sense is such? And for him, who says, that he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Apprehension of an human Form, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ives not, that it is a Man, whence has he taken occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion so to say? Is not from those, who affirm, that they receive an Imagination and Apprehension of a bow'd Figure and Form; but that the Sight pronounces
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:46328:178"/> not the thing, which was seen to have been bowing or round, but that a certain Effigies of it was such? Yes, by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> will some one say; but I, going near the Tower, or touching the Oar, will pronunce and affirm, that the one is strait, and the other has many Angles and Faces; but he, when he comes near it, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that it seems and appears so to him, and no more. Yes certainly, good Sir, and more than this, when he sees and observes the Consequence, that every Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is equally worthy of Belief for it self, and none for another; but that they are all in like Condition. But this your Opinion is quite lost, that all the Imaginations are true, and none false or to be disbeliev'd, if you think, that these, being near, ought to pronounce positively of that, which is without; but those, being far off, you cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit no farther, than that they are so affected. For if they are in equal Condition, as to their being believ'd, when they are neer, or when they are far off, 'tis just, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon all of them, or not upon these, should follow the Judgment, pronouncing, that a thing is; but if there is a Difference in the being affected between those, that are neer, and those, that are far off, it is then false, that one Sense and Imagination is not more express and evident than another. As those, which they call Attestations, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Sense, but somewhat to Opinion: so they would have us, following them, to pronounce concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exterior things: and making Being the Judgment of Opinion, and what appears the Affection of Sense, they transfer the Judicature from that, which is totally true, to that, which often fails. But how full of Trouble and Contradiction, in respect of one another, these things are, what need is there to say at present?</p>
               <p>But the Reputation of <hi>Arcesilaus,</hi> who was the best belov'd, and most esteem'd of all the Philosophers in his Time, seems to have been no small Eye-sore to <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:46328:178"/> who says of him, that delivering nothing, peculiar to himself, or of his own Invention, he imprinted in illiterate Men an Opinion and Esteem of his being very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and learned. Now <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> was so far from desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Glory by being a Bringer in of new Opinions, and from arrogating to himself those of the Ancients, that the Sophisters of that Time blam'd him for attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to <hi>Socrates, Plato, Parmenides,</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> the Doctrines concerning the Retention of Assent, and the Incomprehensibility of things, having no need so to do; but only that he might strengthen them, and render them recommendable by inscribing them to such illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Personages. For this therefore Thanks to <hi>Colotes,</hi> and every one, who declares, that the <hi>Academick</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was from higher Times deriv'd to <hi>Arcesilaus.</hi> Now as for the Retention of Assent, and the Doubting of all things, not even those, who have much labour'd in the Matter, and strain'd themselves to compose great Books, and large Treatises concerning it, were ever able to stir it, but bringing at last out of the <hi>Stoa</hi> it self the Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation from all Actions, as the <hi>Gorgon</hi> to frighten away the Objections, that came against them, were at last quite tir'd and gave over. For they could not, what Attempts and Stirs soever they made, obtain so much from the Instinct, by which the Appetite is mov'd to act, as to suffer it self to be call'd an Assent, or to acknowledge Sense for the Origin, and Principle of its Propension, but it appear'd of its own Accord to present it self to act, as having no need to be joyn'd with any thing else. For against such Adversaries the Combat and Dispute is lawful and just: and
<q>
                     <l>Such Words, as you have spoke, the like you may</l>
                     <l>Expect to hear.â€”</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:46328:179"/>
               <p>For to speak to <hi>Colotes</hi> of Instinct and Consent, is, I suppose, all one as to play on the Harp before an Ass. But to those, who can give ear, and conceive, it is said, that there are in the Soul three sorts of Motions: the Imaginative, the Appetitive, and the Consenting. As to the Imaginative or the Apprehension, it cannot be taken away, thÃ´ one would: for one cannot, when things approach, avoid being inform'd, and, as it were, mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, and receiving an Impression from them. The Appetitive, being stirr'd up by the Imaginative, effectually moves Man to that, which is proper and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his Nature, just as when there is made a Propension and Inclination in the principal and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part. Now those, who withhold their Assent, and doubt of all things, take not away this, but make use of the Appetition or Instinct, naturally conducting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man to that, which seems convenient for him. What then is the only thing, that they shun? That, in which is bred Falshood and Deceit, that is, Opining, applying and giving their Consent, which is a yielding thrÃ´ Weakness to that, which appears, and has not any true Utility. For Action stands in need of two things, to wit, of the Apprehension or Imagination of what is agreeable to Nature, and of the Instinct or Appetition, driving to that, which is so imagin'd: of which, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other is repugnant to the Retention of Assent. For Reason withdraws us from Opinion, and not from Appetition or Imagination. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, which is delectable, seems to us to be proper for us, there is no need of Opinion to move and carry us to it, but Appetition immediately exerts it self, which is nothing else but the Motion and Inclination of the Soul. But a Man must have a Sense, as it were of these things, and be Flesh and Blood, and so the Pleasure also will appear to be good. Wherefore also it will seem good to him, who witholds his Assent: for he also par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46328:179"/> of Sense, and is made of Flesh and Blood, and as soon as he has conceiv'd an Imagination of Good, desires it, and does all things that it may not escape from him; but, as much as possible he can, he will be, and keep himself with that, which is agreeable to his Nature, being drawn by Natural, and not by Geometrical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints. For these goodly, gentle, and tickling Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Flesh, are, without any Teacher, attractive enough of themselves, even as these Men forget not to say, to draw even him, who will not in the least acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confess, that he is softned and rendred pliable by them. But how comes it to pass, perhaps you will say, that he, who is thus doubtful, and withholds his Assent, hastens not away to the Mountain, instead of going to the <hi>Bagnio?</hi> or that rising up to go forth into the Market-place, he runs not his Head against the Wall, but takes his way directly to the Door? Do you ask this, who hold all the Senses to be infallible, and the Apprehensions of the Imagination certain and true? 'Tis, because the <hi>Bagnio</hi> appears to him not a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but a <hi>Bagnio,</hi> and the Door seems not a Wall, but a Door, and the same is to be said of every other thing. For the Doctrine of Retention does not pervert the Sense; nor by absurd Passions and Motions work in it an Alteration, disturbing the imaginative Faculty, but only takes away Opinions, and for the rest makes use of other things according to their Nature.</p>
               <p>But 'tis impossible, you will say, not to consent to things, that are evident: for to deny such things as are believ'd, is more absurd, than neither to deny, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. Who then are they, that call in question things believ'd, and contend against things, that are evident? They, who overthrow and take away Divination, who say, that there is not any Government of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who deny the Sun and the Moon, to whom all Men offer Sacrifices, and whom they honor and adore,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:46328:180"/> to be animated. And do not you take away that, which is apparent to all the World, that the Young are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Nature of their Parents? Do ye not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Sense of all Men, affirm, that there is no <hi>Medium</hi> between Pleasure and Pain, saying not to be in Pain, is to be in the Fruition of Pleasure, that not to do, is to suffer, and that not to rejoyce, is to be griev'd? But to let pass all the rest, what is more evident, and more generally believ'd by all Men, than that those, who are seiz'd with Melancholy Distempers, and whose Brain is troubled, and their Wits distracted, do, when the Fit is on them, and their Understanding alter'd and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, imagin, that they see and hear things, which they neither see nor hear? Whence they frequently cry out:
<q>
                     <l>Women, in Black array'd, bear in their Hands,</l>
                     <l>To burn mine Eyes, Torches and fiery Brands.</l>
                  </q> And again,
<q>See, in her Arms she holds my Mother dear.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These and many other Illusions, more strange and tragical than these, resembling those <hi>Mormoes</hi> and <hi>Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears,</hi> which they themselves laugh at and deride, as they are describ'd by <hi>Empedocles</hi> to be,
<q>
                     <l>Bow-legg'd, Ram-headed, body'd like an Ox,</l>
                     <l>And fac'd like Man,â€”</l>
                  </q> with certain other prodigious and unnatural Phantoms, these Men, having gather'd together out of Dreams, and the Alienations of Distracted Minds, affirm, that none of them is a Deception of the Sight, a Falsity, or Inconsistence; but that all these Imaginations are true,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:46328:180"/> being Bodies and Figures; that come from the ambient Air. What thing then is there so impossible in Nature, as to be doubted of, if it is possible to believe such Reveries as these? For these Men, supposing, that such things, as never any Mask-maker, Potter, Framer of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Images, or skilful and all-daring Painter durst joyn together, to deceive, or make Sport for the Beholders, are seriously, and in good earnest existent, nay, which is more, affirming, that if they are not really so, all Firmness of Belief, all Certainty of Judgment and Truth is for ever gone, do by these their Suppositions and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations cast all things into Obscurity, and bring Fears into our Judgments, and Suspicions into our Actions, if those things which we apprehend, do, are familiarly acquainted with, and have at band, are grounded on the same Imagination and Belief with these furious, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, and extravagant Phansies. For the Equality, which they suppose to be in all Apprehensions, rather derogates from the Credit of such, as are usual and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, than adds any Belief to those, that are unusual and repugnant to Reason. Wherefore we know many Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who would rather, and more willingly grant, that no Imagination is true, than that all are so, and that would rather simply disbelieve all the Men, they never had convers'd with, all the things, they had not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented, and all the Speeches, they had not heard with their own Ears, than perswa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46328:181"/>
'tis lawful for us to retain our Assent concerning them, thÃ´ there were no other Cause, but this Discor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, which is sufficient to work in us a Suspicion of things, as having nothing certain and assur'd, but being altogether full of Obscurity and Perturbation. For in the Infinities of the World, and the Nature of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and the Differences of <hi>Individuums</hi> and Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, althÃ´ they trouble and disturb very many, there is yet this Comfort, that none of all these things, that are in question, is near us, but rather every one of them far remote from Sense. But as to this Diffidence, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and Ignorance, concerning sensible things and Imaginations, presented to our Eyes, our Ears, and our Hands, what Opinion does it not shock? What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent does it not turn upside down? For if Men, neither Drunk, Intoxicated, nor otherwise disturb'd in their Senses, but sober, sound in Mind, and professedly writing of the Truth, and of the Canons and Rules, by which to judge it, do in the most evident Passions and Motions of the Sense set down either that, which has no Exis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for true, or that, which is existent, for false; 'tis neither to be admir'd, nor incredible, if they give no Judgment of the Imaginations, that appear, but are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of contrary Judgments. For 'tis less to be wondred, that a Man should neither affirm the one nor the other, but keep himself in a Meen between two opposite things, than that he should set down things, repugnant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to one another. For he, that neither affirms nor denys, but keeps himself quiet, is less repugnant to him, who affirms an Opinion, than he, who denies it, and to him who denies an Opinion, than he, who affirms it. Now if 'tis possible to withhold ones Assent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these things, 'tis not impossible also concerning others, at least according to your Opinion, who say, that one Sense does not exceed another, nor one Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation another. The Doctrine then of retaining the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46328:181"/> Assent, is not, as <hi>Colotes</hi> thinks, a Fable, or an Invention of rash and light headed Young Men, who please themselves in babbling and prating; but a certain Habit and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Men, who desire to keep themselves from mistaking and falling into Error, not leaving the Judgment at a venture to such suspected and inconstant Senses, nor suffering themselves to be deceiv'd with those, who hold, that things, which appear, are credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ought to be believ'd, as certain, when they see so great an Obscurity and Uncertainty in Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Appearances. But the Infinity, you assert, is a Fable, and so indeed are the Images, you dream of, and he breeds in Young Men Rashness and Self-conceitedness, who writ of <hi>Pythocles,</hi> not yet eighteen years of Age, that there was not in all <hi>Greece</hi> a better or more excellent Nature, that he admirably well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd his Conceptions, and that his Case was much like that of Women, praying, that all these extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Endowments of the Young Man might not work him Hatred and Envy.</p>
               <p>But these are Sophisters, and arrogant, who write so impudently and proudly against great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Personages.

                  </gap>sides <hi>Colotes,</hi> set forth with such an insolent Title, as this, against all at once. Whence it comes to pass, that like to such, as have offended some Divinity, confessing his Fault, he says thus towards the end of his Book: <hi>Those, who have established Laws and Ordinances, and instituted Monarchies and other Governments in Towns and Cities, have plac'd human Life in great Repose and Security, and deliver'd it from many Troubles; and, if any one should go about to take this away, we should lead the Live of savage Beasts, and should be every one ready to eat up one another, as we meet.</hi> For these are the very words of <hi>Colotes,</hi> thÃ´ neither
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46328:182"/> justly nor truly spoken. For if any one, taking away the Laws, should leave us nevertheless the Doctrins of <hi>Parmenides, Socrates, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> we should be far from mutually devouring one another, and leading the Life of Beasts: for we should fear dishonest things, and should for Honesty alone venerate Justice, the Gods, our Superiours, and Magistrates, believing, that we have Spirits and Daemons, who are the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Superintendents of human Life, esteeming all the Gold, that is upon and within the Earth, not to be equivalent to vertue, and doing that willingly by reason, as <hi>Xenocrates</hi> says, which we now do by force, and thrÃ´ fear of the Law. When then will our Life become savage and bestial? When, the Laws being taken away, there shall be left Books and Doctrines, inciting Men to Pleasure, when the World shall be thought not to be rul'd and govern'd by divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when those Men shall be esteem'd wise, who shall spit at Honesty, if it is not joyn'd with Pleasure, and such Discourses and Sentences, as these, shall be scoft at, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rided:
<q>Gods Justice has one Eye, which all things sees:</q> And again:
<q>God near us stands, and views, what ere we do:</q> And once more: God, as Antiquity has deliver'd to us, holding the Beginning, Middle and End of the Universe, makes a direct Line, walking according to Nature. After him follows Justice, a Punisher of those, who have been deficient in their Duties by trangres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the divine Law. For they, who contemn these things, as if they were Fables, and think, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Good of Man consists about the Belly, and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:46328:182"/> in those other Labours, by which Pleasure is procur'd, are such as stand in need of the Law, and Fear, and Stripes, and some King, Prince, or Magistrate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his hand the Sword of Justice: to the end they may not devour their Neighbours thrÃ´ their Gluttony, render'd confident by their Atheistical Impiety. For this is the Life of Brutes, because brute Beasts know nothing better, nor more honest then Pleasure, understand not the Justice of the Gods, nor revere the Beauty of Vertue, but if Nature has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd on them any Point of Courage, Subtilty, or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, they make use of it for the Satisfaction of their fleshly Pleasure, and the Accomplishment of their Lusts. And therefore <hi>Metrodorus</hi> is esteem'd by them a very wise Man, when he says; <hi>All the sine, subtle, and ingenious Inventions of the Soul have been found out for the Pleasure and Delight of the Flesh, or for the Hopes of attaining to it and enjoying it, and every Act, which tends not to this End, is vain and unprofitable.</hi> The Laws being by such Discourses and Philosophical Reasons, as these, taken away, there wants nothing to a beast like Life, but Lions Paws, Wolves Teeth, Oxens Paunches, and Camels Necks: and these Passions and Doctrins do the Beasts themselves for want of Speech and Letters express by their Bellowings, Neighings, and Brayings, all their Voice being for their Belly, and the Pleasure of their Flesh, which they embrace and rejoyce in either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or future; unless it be perhaps some Animal, which naturally takes Delight in Chattering and Garrulity. No sufficient Praise therefore, or equivalent to their Deserts, can be given those, who, for the restraining of such bestial Passions, have set down Laws, establish'd Policy and Government of State, instituted Magistrates, and ordain'd good and wholsom Decrees.</p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:46328:183"/>
               <p>But who are they, that utterly confound and abolish this? Are they not those, who say, that the Garland of Tranquillity and a repos'd Life is not comparable to, but far more valuable than all the Kingdoms and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities in the World? Are they not those, who declare, that Reigning and being a King is a mistaking the Path, and straying from the right way of Felicity? And who write in express Terms: <hi>We are to treat, how a Man may best keep and preserve the End of Nature, and how he may from the very Beginning avoid entring of his own Free-will and voluntarily upon Offices of Magistracy, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over the People:</hi> And yet again these other Words are theirs: <hi>There is no need at all that a Man should tire out his Mind and Body to preserve the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and to obtain from them a Crown of Wisdom; but to eat and drink well, Ã´</hi> Timocrates, <hi>without prejudicing, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleasing the Flesh.</hi> And yet in the Constitution of Laws and Policy, which <hi>Colotes</hi> so much praises, the first and most important Article is the Belief and Perswasion of the Gods: wherefore also <hi>Lycurgus</hi> heretofore sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd the <hi>Lacedaemonians, Numae</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> the ancient <hi>Ion</hi> the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Deucalion</hi> universally all the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by rendring them devout and affectionate to the Gods in Prayers, Oaths, Oracles, and Prophesies, by means of the Hope and Fear, they imprinted in their Minds. And if you will take the Pains to travel thrÃ´ the World, you may find Towns and Cities without Walls, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Letters, without Kings, without Houses, without Wealth, without Money, without Theatres and Places of Exercise; but there was never seen nor shall be seen by Man any one City without Temples and Gods, or without making use of Prayers, Oaths, Prophesies, and Sacrifices for the obtaining of Blessings and Benefits, and the averting of Curses and Calamities. Nay I am of Opinion, that a City might sooner be built without any Ground, to fix it on, than a Common-weal be constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46328:183"/> altogether void of Religion, and the Opinion of the Gods, or being constituted, be preserv'd. But this, which is the Foundation and Ground of all Laws, do these Men, not going circularly about, nor secretly and by enigmatical Speeches, but attacking it with the first of their most principal Opinions, directly subvert and overthrow: and then afterwards, as if they were haunted by the Furies, they come, and confess, that they have grievously offended in thus taking away the Laws, and confounding the Ordinances of Justice and Policy, that they may not be capable of Pardon. For to err in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, thÃ´ it be not the part of wise Men, is at least human; but to impute to others the Errors and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they commit themselves, how can any one declare, what it is, if he forbears to give it the Name, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves? For if in writing against <hi>Antidorus,</hi> or <hi>Bion,</hi> the Sophister, he had made mention of Laws, Policy, Order, and Justice, might not either of them have said to him, as <hi>Electea</hi> did to her mad Brother <hi>Orestes:</hi>
                  <q>Lye still at ease, poor wretch, keep in thy Bed,</q> and there cherish thy <hi>Corpusculum,</hi> leaving those to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate and find fault with me, who have themselves liv'd oeconomically and politically? Now such are all those, whom <hi>Colotes</hi> has revil'd and rail'd at in his Book.</p>
               <p>Amongst whom <hi>Democritus</hi> in his Writings advises, and exhorts to the Learning of the military Science, as being the greatest of all, and to the accustoming ones self to bear the Fatigues of it, by which Men attain to great Wealth and Honor. And as for <hi>Parmenides,</hi> he beautify'd and adorn'd his native Country with most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Laws, which he there establish'd, so that even to this Day the Officers every year, when they enter first on the Exercise of their Charges, are oblig'd to swear,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:46328:184"/> that they will observe the Laws and Ordinances of <hi>Parmenides. Empedocles</hi> brought to Justice some of the principal of his City, and caus'd them to be condemn'd for their insolent Behavior, and Embezling of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treasure, and also deliver'd his Country from Sterility and the Plague, to which Calamities it was before subject, by immuring and stopping up the Holes of certain Mountains, whence there issu'd an hot South-wind, which overspread all the plain Country, and blasted it. And <hi>Socrates,</hi> after he was condemn'd, when his Friends offer'd him, if he pleas'd, an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of making his Escape, absolutely refus'd to make use of it, that he might maintain the Authority of the Laws, choosing rather to dy unjustly, than to save himself by disobeying the Laws of his Country, <hi>Melissus,</hi> being <hi>Praetor,</hi> or Captain General of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, vanquisht the <hi>Athenians</hi> in a Battle at Sea. <hi>Plato</hi> left in his Writings excellent Discourses concerning the Laws, Government, and Policy of a Commonweal, and yet he imprinted much better in the Hearts and Minds of his Disciples and Familiars, which were the Cause of <hi>Dions</hi> delivering <hi>Sicily</hi> from the Tyranny of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and that <hi>Thrace</hi> was set at liberty by <hi>Pytho</hi> and <hi>Heraclides,</hi> who slew <hi>Cotys. Chabrias</hi> also and <hi>Phocion,</hi> those two great Generals of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> came out of the <hi>Academy;</hi> or <hi>Plato's</hi> School. As for <hi>Epicurus</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed sent certain Persons into <hi>Asia</hi> to chide <hi>Timocrates,</hi> and remov'd him out of the Kings Palace, because he had offended his Brother <hi>Metrodorus;</hi> and this is written in their own Books. But <hi>Plato</hi> sent of his Disciples and Friends <hi>Aristonymus</hi> to the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> to set in order their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, <hi>Phormio</hi> to the <hi>Eleaeans,</hi> and <hi>Menedemus</hi> to the <hi>Pyrrhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Eudoxus</hi> gave Laws to the <hi>Cnidians,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> to the <hi>Stagirites,</hi> who were both of them the Intimates of <hi>Plato.</hi> And <hi>Alexander</hi> the great demanded of <hi>Xenocrates</hi> Rules and Precepts for reigning well. And he, who
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46328:184"/> was sent to the same <hi>Alexander</hi> by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in <hi>Asia,</hi> and most of all inflam'd and stimulated him to embrace and undertake the War against the <hi>Barbarian</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> was <hi>Delius</hi> the <hi>Ephesian,</hi> one of <hi>Plato's</hi> Familiars. <hi>Zeno,</hi> the Disciple of <hi>Parmenides,</hi> having attempted to kill the Tyrant <hi>Demylus,</hi> and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Design, maintain'd the Doctrin of <hi>Epimenides,</hi> like pure and fine Gold, try'd in the Fire, that there is nothing, which a magnanimous Man ought to dread, but Dishonor, and that there are none, but Children and Women, or effeminate and women-hearted Men, who fear Pain: for having with his own Teeth bitten off his Tongue, he spit it in the Tyrants Face. But out of the School of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and from among those, who follow his Doctrin, I will not ask, what Tyrant-killer has proceeded, nor yet what Man, valiant and victorious in Feats of Arms, what Lawgiver, what Prince, what Councellor, or what Governor of the People; neither will I demand, who of them has been tormented or dy'd for supporting of Right and Justice.

What Record is there extant of one Civil Action in matter of Government, perform'd by any of you? And yet because <hi>Metrodorus</hi> went down one day from the City as far as the Haven of <hi>Pyreum,</hi> taking a Journey of forty <hi>Stadia</hi> or four or five Miles, to assist <hi>Mithres</hi> a <hi>Syrian,</hi> one of the King of <hi>Persians</hi> Court, who had been arrested and taken Prisoner, he writ of it to every one, and in all his Letters, <hi>Epicurus</hi> also highly manifying and extolling this wonderful Voyage. What value then, think youâ–ª would they have put upon it, if they had done such an Act, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> did, who procur'd the Restauration and Rebuilding of <hi>Stagira,</hi> the Town of his Nativity, after it had been destroy'd
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46328:185"/> by King <hi>Philip,</hi> or as <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> who twice deliver'd his City, when possess'd and held by Tyrants? Would not the Rlver <hi>Nilus</hi> sooner have given over to bear the Paper-reed, than they have been weary of writing their brave Exploits?</p>
               <p>And is it not a very great Indignity, that of so many Sects of Philosophers, as have been extant, they alone should enjoy the Benefits, that are in Cities, without having ever contributed to them any thing of their own? There are not even any Tragical or Comical Poets, who do not always endeavor to do or say some good thing or other in defence of the Laws and Policy: But these Men, if peradventure they write, write of Policy, that we may not concern our selves in the Government of the Commonweal; of Rhetorick, that we may not perform any Act of Eloquence; and of Royalty, that we may shun the Living and Conversing with Kings: nor do they ever name any of those great Personages, who have intermedled in Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but only to scoff at them, and abolish their Glory.

But methinks I ought not in this Place to omit, what <hi>Metrodorus</hi> writ in his Book of Philosophy, when utterly abjuring all Medling in the Management of the State, he said thus: <hi>Some thrÃ´ an Abundance of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Arrogance have so deep an Insight into the Business of it, that in treating about the Precepts of good Life and Vertue, they suffer themselves to be carry'd away with the very same Desires, as were</hi> Lycurgus <hi>and</hi> Solon. What
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46328:185"/> is this? Was it then Vanity, and Abundance of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to set free the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> to render <hi>Sparta</hi> well-policy'd and govern'd by wholsom Laws, that young Men might do nothing licentiously, nor get Children upon common Courtesans and Whores, and that Riches, Delights, Intemperance, and Dissolution, might no longer bear sway, and have Command in Cities, but Law and Justice? For these were the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of <hi>Solon.</hi> To this <hi>Metrodorus</hi> by way of Scorn and Contumely adds this Conclusion: <hi>It is then very well beseeming a Gentleman to laugh heartily, as at other Men, so especially at these</hi> Solons <hi>and</hi> Lycurguses. But such an one, Ã´ <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> is not a Gentleman, but a servile, and dissolute Person, and deserves to be scourg'd, not with that Whip, which is for free-born Persons, but with that<note n="*" place="margin">This was a Scourge of several Strings, at the Ends of which were fastned Ankle-bones, call'd <hi>Astragali,</hi> to render it more smarting.</note>
                  <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galote</hi> or Cat-of-nine-tails, with which those gelded Sacrificers, call'd<note n="â€ " place="margin">These were the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Priests of <hi>Cybele,</hi> suppos'd to be so call'd from the River <hi>Gallus,</hi> by the liberal Drinking of whose Water they fell mad, and castrated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note>
                  <hi>Galli,</hi> were wont to be chastis'd, when they fail'd of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their Duty in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Sacrifices of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess <hi>Cybele,</hi> the great Mother of the Gods. But that they made War not against the Lawgivers, but against the Laws themselves, one may hear and understand from <hi>Epicurus:</hi> for in his Questions he asks himself; Whether a wise Man, being assur'd, that it will not be known, will do any thing, that the Laws forbid: to which he answers: <hi>A simple Determination is not ready, that is, I will do it indeed; but I am not willing to confess it.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I suppose, writing to <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> he exhorts him not to make his Life a Slave to the Laws, nor to the Opinions of Men, unless it be to avoid the Trouble,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46328:186"/> they prepare, by the Scourge and Chastisement, so near at hand. If then those, who abolish the Laws, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and Policies of Men, subvert and destroy human Life, and if <hi>Metrodorus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> do this by dehorting and withdrawing their Friends from concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves in publick Affairs, by hating those, who intermeddle in them, by reviling the first most wise Lawgivers, and by advising the Contempt of the Laws, provided there is no Fear and Danger of the Whip and Punishment, I do not see, that <hi>Colotes</hi> has brought so many false Accusations against the other Philosophers, as he has alledg'd and advanc'd true ones against the Writings and Doctrins of <hi>Epicurus.</hi>

               <byline>Translated out of the <hi>Greek</hi> by <hi>Robert Midgley,</hi> M. D. <hi>&amp;</hi> Col. Med. Lond. Cand. <hi>Plutarch</hi> to his Wife, <hi>All Health:</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>AS for the Messenger you dispatched to tell me of the Death of my little Daughter, it seems he miss'd his way as he was going to <hi>Athens.</hi> But when I came to <hi>Tanagra,</hi> I heard of it by my <hi>Neice.</hi> I suppose by this time the Funeral is over. I wish, that whatever happens as well now as hereafter, may create you no Dissatisfaction. But if you have designedly let any thing alone, depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my judgment, thinking better to determin the point if I were with you, I pray let it be without Ceremony and timerous Superstition, which I know are far from you. Only, dear Wife, let you and me bear our Affliction with Patience. I know very well, and do comprehend, what a loss we have had; but
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46328:187"/> if I should find you grieve beyond Measure, this would trouble me more than the thing it self; for I had my Birth neither from a Stock nor a Stone; and you know it full well, I having been assistant to you in the Education of so many Children, which we brought up at Home under our own Care. This much-lamented Daughter, was born after four Sons, which made me call her by your own Name; therefore I know she was dear to you, and Grief must have a peculiar Pungency in a Mind tenderly affectionate to Children, when you call to Mind how naturally witty and innocent she was, void of Anger and not querelous. She was naturally mild, and compassionate to a Miracle. And she show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Delight in, and gave a Specimen of her Humanity and Gratitude towards any thing that had obliged her; for she would pray her Nurse to give suck, not only to other Children, but to her very play-things, as it were courteously inviting them to her Table, and making the best Chear for them she could. Now, my dear Wife, I see no Reason why these and the like things, which delighted us so much when she was alive, should upon Remembrance of them afflict us when she is dead. But I also fear, lest while we cease from Sorrowing, we should forget her, as <hi>Clymene</hi> said,
<q>
                     <l>I hate the handy horned Bow,</l>
                     <l>And banish Youthful Pastimes now:</l>
                  </q> because she would not be put in Mind of her Son, by the Exercises he had been used to. For Nature always shuns such things as are troublesome. But since our little Daughter afforded all our Sences the sweetest and most charming Pleasure; so ought we to cherish her Memory, which will many Ways conduce more to our Joy than our Grief. And it is but just, that the same Arguments which we have oft-times used to others, should prevail upon our selves at this so seasonable a
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46328:187"/> time, and that we should not supinely sit down, and overwhelm the Joys which we have tasted, with a Multiplicity of new Griefs. Moreover, they who were present at the Funeral, report this with Admiration, That you neither put on Mourning, nor disfigured your self or any of your Maids; neither were there any costly Preparations nor magnificent Pomp, but that all things were managed with Prudence and Moderation. And it seemed not strange to me, that you, who never used richly to dress your self, for the Theatre or other Public Solemnities, esteeming such Magnificence vain and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less even in Matters of Delight, have now practis'd Frugality on this funest Occasion. For, a vertuous Woman ought not only to preserve her Purity in Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Feasts, but also to think thus with her self, That the Tempest of the Mind in violent Grief must be calmed by Patience; which does not intrench on the Natural Love of Parents towards their Children, as many think, but only struggles against the disorderly and irregular Passions of the Mind. For, we allow this Love of Children to discover it self, in lamenting, wishing for and longing after them when they are dead. But the excessive Inclination to Grief, which carries People on to unseemly Exclamations and furious Behaviour, is no less culpable, than luxurious Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. Yet Reason seems to plead in its Excuse; because, instead of Pleasure, Grief and Sorrow are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of the Crime. What can be more Irrational, I pray, than to check excessive Laughter and Joy, and yet to give a free Course to Rivers of Tears and Sighs, which flow from the same Fountain? Or, as some do quarrel with their Wives for using some Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Helps to Beauty; and in the mean time suffer them to shave their Heads, wear the mournful Black, sit disconsolate, and lie in pain? and, which is worst of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46328:188"/> all, if their Wives at any time chastise their Servants or Maids immoderately, they will interpose and hinder them; but, at the same time suffering them to torment and punish themselves most cruelly, in a Case which peculiarly requires their greatest. Tenderness and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity? But between us, dear Wife, there never was any Occasion for such Contests, nor, I think, ever will. For there is no Philosopher of your Acquaintance, who is not in love with your Frugality, both in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel and Diet; nor a Citizen, to whom the Simplicity and Meanness of your Dress is not conspicuous, both at Religious Sacrifices, and Public Shews in the Theatre. Formerly also, you discovered on the like Occasion, a great Constancy of Men, when you lost your Eldest Son. And again, when the lovely <hi>Charon</hi> left us. For I remember, when the News was brought me of my Sons Death, as I was returning Home with some Friends and Guests who accompanied me to my House, that when they beheld all Things in Order, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a profound Silence every where, (as they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards declared to others) they thought no such Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity had happened, but that the Report was false. So discreetly had you settled the Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>irs of the House, at that Time when no small Confusion and Disorder might have been expec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ed. And yet you gave this Son suck your self, and endured the lancing of your Breast, to prevent the ill Effects of a Contusion. These are Things worthy of a generous Woman, and one that loves her Children. Whereas, we see most other Women to receive their Children in their Hands as Play-things, with a Feminine Mirth and Jollity, and afterwards, if they chance to die, they will drench themselves in the most vain and excessive So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> ow. Not that this is any Effect of their Love (for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>t gentle Passion acts regularly and discreetly) but it rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a Desire of Vain-glory, mix'd with a little
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46328:188"/> Natural Affection, which renders their Mourning bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, brutish and extravagant. Which Thing <hi>Aesop</hi> knew very well, when he tells the Story of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s giving Honours to the <hi>Gods;</hi> for, it seems, <hi>Grief</hi> also made her Demands, and it was granted that she should be honoured, but only by those who were willing of their own Accord to do it. And indeed, this is the Beginning of Sorrow. Every Body first gives her free Access; and after she is once rooted and settled, and become familiar, she will not be forced thence with their best Endeavors. Therefore she must be resisted at her first Approach, nor must we surrender the Fort to her by any exterior Signs, whether of Apparel, or shaving the Hair, or any other such like Symptoms of mournful Weakness; which hapning daily, and wounding us by Degrees with a kind of foolish Bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, at length do so enervate the Mind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her to such Streights, that quite dejected and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged with Grief, the poor timerous Wretch dare not be merry, or see the light, or eat and drink in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. This Inconvenience is accompanied by a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Body, Carelesness of Anointing and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, with whatsoever else relates to the Elegancy of Human Life. Whereas, on the contrary, the Soul, when it is disordered, ought to receive Aid from the Vigor of a healthful Body. For, the sharpest Edge of the Souls Grief, is rebated and slack'd when the Body is in Tranquility and Ease, like the Sea in a Calm. But where, from an ill Course of Diet, the Body becomes dry and hot, so that it cannot supply the Soul with commodious and serene Spirits, but only breaths forth Melancholy Vapors and Exhalations, which perpetually annoy her with Grief and Sadness; there it is difficult for a Man (tho never so willing and desirous) to recover the Tranquillity of his Mind,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46328:189"/> after it has been disturbed with so many evil Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But, that which is most to be dreaded in this Case, does not at all affrighten me, to wit, the Visits of foolish Women, and their accompanying you in your Tears and Lamentations; by which they sharpen your Grief, not suffering it either of it self, or by the Help of others, to fade and vanish away. For, I am not ignorant how great a Combat you lately entred, when you assisted the Sister of <hi>Theon,</hi> and opposed the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who came running in with horrid Cries and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, bringing Fewel as it were to her Passion. Assuredly, when Men see their Neighbors House on Fire, every one contributes his utmost to quench it: but when they see the Mind inflamed with furious Passion, they bring Fewel to nourish and encrease the Flame. When a Man's Eye is in pain, he is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to touch it, tho the Inflammation provoke him to it, nor will they that are near him meddle with it. But he who is gaul'd with Grief, sits and exposes his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper to every one, like Waters that all may poach in; and so that which at first seem'd a light Itching, or trivial Smart, by much fretting and provoking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a great and almost incurable Disease. But, I know very well, that you will arm your self against these Inconveniences. Moreover, I would have you endeavor to call often to Mind that Time, when our Daughter was not as yet born to us; then we had no cause to complain of Fortune. Then, joining that Time with this, argue thus with your self, that we are now in the same Condition as then. Otherwise, dear Wife, we shall seem discontented at the Birth of our little Daughter, if we own that our Circumstances were better before her Birth. But the two Years of her Life, are by no means to be forgotten by us, but to be numbred amongst our Blessings, in that they afforded
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46328:189"/> us an agreeable Pleasure. Nor must we esteem a small Good for a great Evil; nor ungratefully complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Fortune, for what she has actually given us, because she has not added what we wish'd for. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, to speak reverently of the <hi>Gods,</hi> and to bear our Lot with an even Mind, without accusing Fortune, always brings with it a fair Reward. But he who in such a Case calls prosperous Things to Mind, and turning his Thoughts from dark and melancholly Objects, fixes them on bright and chearful ones; he wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> either quite extinguish his Grief, or by allaying it with contrary Sentiments, will render it weak and feeble. For, as a Perfume brings Delight to the Nose, and arms it against ill Scents; so, the Remembrance of Happiness gives necessary Assistance in Adversity to those who avoid not the Recollection of their past Prosperity, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain at all against Fortune, which certainly would little become us, to accuse our Life, if like a Book it hath but one little Blot in it, tho all the rest be fair and clean. For you have oftentimes heard, that true Happiness consists in the right Discourses and Counsels of the Mind, tending to its own constant Establishment; and that the Changes of Fortune are of no great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the Felicity of our Life. But yet, if we must also be governed by exterior things, and with the common Sort of People have a Regard to Casualties, and suffer any kind of Men to be judges of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; however, do not you take notice of the Tears and Moans of such as visit you at present, condoling your Misfortune; for, their Tears and Sighs are but of Course. But rather, do you consider how happy every one of them esteems you, for the Children you have, the House you keep, and the Life you lead For it would be an ill thing, while others covet your Fortune, though sullied with this Affliction, that you should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46328:190"/> against what you enjoy; and not be sensible from this Tast of Affliction how grateful you ought to be for the Happiness which remains untouched. Or, like some, who collecting all the Defective Verses of <hi>Homer,</hi>

And these are not to be esteemed great Evils where they are wanted, and small Benefits where they are enjoyed. But so long as she is gone to a Place where she feels no Pain, she has no need of our Grief. For, what Harm can befall us from her, when she is free from all Hurt? And surely the Loss of great Things abates its Grief, when it is come to this, that there is no more Ground of Grief or Care for them. But thy <hi>Timoxena</hi> was deprived but of small Matters; for, she had no Knowledge but of such, neither took she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light but in such small Things. But for that which she never was sensible of, nor so much as once did enter into her Thoughts, how can you say it is taken from her?</p>
               <p>As for what you hear others say, who perswade the Vulgar, that the Soul when once freed from the Body suffers no Inconvenience or Evil, nor is sensible at all, I know that you are better grounded in the Doctrines delivered down to us from our Ancestors, as also in the Sacred Mysteries of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> than to believe such Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for, the Religious Symbols are well known to
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46328:190"/> us who are of the Fraternity. Therefore be assured, that the Soul being incapable of Death, suffers in the same Manner as Birds that are kept in a Cage. For, if she has been a long time educated and cherished in the Body, and by long Custom has been made familiar with most Things of this Life, she will (though separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) return again, and at length enter the Body; nor ceaseth it by new Births now and then to be entangled in the Chances and Events of this Life. For, do not think that Old Age, is therefore evil spoken of and blamed, because it is accompanied with Wrinkles, Gray-Hairs, and Weakness of Body: but this is the most troublesome thing in Old Age, that it staineth and corrupteth the Soul with the Remembrance of Things relating to the Body, to which she was too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted; thus it bendeth and boweth, retaining that Form which it took of the Body. But that which is taken away in Youth, being more soft and tractable, soon returns to its native Vigor and Beauty just like Fire that is quenched, which if it be forthwith kindled again, sparkles and burns out immediately,
<q>
                     <l>As soon as e're we take our Breath,</l>
                     <l>'Twere good to pass the Gates of Death,</l>

But, the Truth of this will appear in the Laws and Traditions received from our Ancestors: for, when any Children dye, no Libations nor Sacrifices are made for them, nor any other of those Ceremonies which are wont to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for the Dead. For, Infants have no part of Earth or Earthly Affections. Nor do they hover or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46328:191"/> their dead Bodies are exposed. The Religion of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try teaches us otherwise, and it is an Impious Thing not to believe what our Laws and Traditions assert, That the Souls of Infants pass immediately into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more Divine State. Wherefore, since it is safer to give Credit to our Traditions, than to call them in Question, let us comply with the Custom in outward and publick Behaviour; and let our Interiour, be more unpolluted, pure and holy.</p>

               <p>AS I was considering with my self to bring forth and propose to the Judgment of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Company the Discourse, I held yesterday in your Presence, methoughts, I heard Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vertue, I know not whether in the Illusion of a Dream, or in a true and real Vision, say thus to me:
<q>A golden Ground is laid for sacred Songs.</q> We have already laid the Foundation of the Discourse by perswading and exhorting persons to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in managing the Affairs of the Commonweal, and now we proceed to build upon it the Doctrin, which is due after such an Exhortation. For after a Man has receiv'd an Admonition and Exhortation to deal in the Affairs of the State, there ought consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46328:192"/> to be given him Precepts of Government, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and observing which, he may, as much as 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a Man to do, profit the Public, and in the mean time honestly prosecute his own Affairs with such Safety and Honor, as shall be meet for him.</p>
               <p>There is first then one Point to be discours'd, which, as it is precedent to what we have hereafter to say, so it depends on what we have already said before. Now this is, what sort of <hi>Policy</hi> and Government is best: for as there are many Sorts of Lives in particular Men, so also are there in People and States; and the Life of a People or State is its <hi>Policy</hi> and Government. 'Tis therefore necessary to declare, which is the best, that a Statesman may choose it from among the rest, or, if that is impossible for him to do, he may at least take that, which has the nearest Resemblance to the best.</p>
               <p>Now there is one Signification of this Word <hi>Policy,</hi> which imports as much as <hi>Burgess-ship,</hi> that is a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation in the Rights and Priviledges, belonging to a Town, City, or Borough: as when we say, that the <hi>Megarians</hi> by an Edict of their City presented <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great with their <hi>Policy,</hi> that is, their <hi>Burgess-ship,</hi> and that, <hi>Alexander</hi> laughing at the Offer they made him of it, they answer'd him, that they had never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that Honor to any but <hi>Hercules,</hi> and now to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. This he wondring to hear, accepted their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, thinking it honorable, inasmuch as it was rare. The Life also of a political Person, who is concern'd in the Government of the Commonweal, is call'd <hi>Policy,</hi> as when we praise the <hi>Policy</hi> of <hi>Pericles</hi> or <hi>Bias,</hi> that is, the manner of their Government, and on the contrary, blame that of <hi>Hyperbolus</hi> and <hi>Cleon.</hi> Some moreover there are, who call a great and memorable Action, perform'd in the Administration of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal, a <hi>Policy,</hi> such as is the Distribution of Money, the Suppressing of a War, the Introduction of some
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46328:192"/> notable Decree, worthy to be kept in perpetual Memory. In which Signification 'tis a common manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to say, <hi>This Man to day has done a</hi> Policy, if he has peradventure effected some remarkable Matter in the Government of the State.</p>
               <p>Besides all these Significations there is yet another, that is, the Order and State by which a Commonweal is govern'd, and by which Affairs are manag'd and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred. According to which we say, that there are three sorts of <hi>Policy,</hi> or publick Government, to wit, <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which is Regality or Kingship; <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> which is the Government by Peers and Nobles; and <hi>Democracy,</hi> which is a popular, or, as we term it, a free State. Now all these are mention'd by <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his third Book, where he compares them one with another. And these seem to be the most general of all: for that all other Sorts are, as it were, the Depravation or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of these, either by Defect, or Excess, as it is in the first Consonances of Musick, when the Strings are either too streight or too slack.</p>
               <p>Now these Three Sorts of Government have been distributed amongst the Nations, that have had the greatest Empire, or greater than any other. Thus the <hi>Persians</hi> enjoy'd Regality or Kingship, because their King had full and absolute Power in all things, without being lyable to render an Account to any one. The <hi>Spartans</hi> had a Council, consisting of a small Number, and those the best and most considerable Persons in the City, who dispatcht all Affairs. The <hi>Athenians</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd popular Government, free and exempt from any other Mixture. In which Administration when there are any Faults, their Transgressions and Exorbitancies are styl'd Tyrannies, Oppressions of the Stronger, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled Licentiousness of the Multitude. That is, when the Prince, who has the Royalty, permits himself to outrage whom ever he pleases, and will not suffer any
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46328:193"/> Remonstrance to be made him concerning it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Tyrant: When a few Lords or Senators, in whose Hands the Government is, arrive at that Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance as to contemn all others, they turn Oppressors: And when a popular State breaks forth into Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Levelling, it runs into Anarchy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable Liberty: and in a word, all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will be Rashness and Folly.</p>
               <p>Even then as a skilful Musician will make use of all sorts of Instruments, and play on every one of them, accommodating himself in such manner, as its Quality can bear, and as shall be fit to make it yield the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Sound; but yet, if he will follow <hi>Plato</hi>'s Counsel, he will lay-aside <hi>Fiddles,</hi> many string'd <hi>Virginals, Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,</hi> and <hi>Harps,</hi> preferring before all other the <hi>Lute</hi> and <hi>Bandore.</hi> In like manner, an able Statesman will dextrously manage the <hi>Laconick,</hi> and <hi>Lycurgian</hi> Seignory, or <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> fitting and accommodating his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who are of equal Authority with him, and by little and little drawing and reducing them to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd by himself: he will also carry himself discreetly in a Popular State, as if he had to deal with an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many and differently sounding Strings, one while letting down and remitting some things, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain extending others, as he shall see his Opportunity, and find it most convenient for the Government, to which he will vigorously apply himself, well knowing, when and how he ought to resist and contradict; but yet, if he might be permitted to make his Choice from amongst all sorts of Government, as from so many Musical Instruments, he would not, if <hi>Plato</hi>'s Advice might be taken, choose any other but Monarchy, or Regal Authority, as being that, which is indeed only able to support that most perfect and most lofty Note of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuÃ¨, without suffering him, either by Force, or by Grace and Favor, to frame himself for Advantage
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46328:193"/> and Gain. For all other sorts of Government, do in a manner as much rule a Statesman, as he does them, no less carrying him, than they are carry'd by him; forasmuch as he has no certain Power over those, from whom he has his Authority; but is very often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to cry out in these Words of the Poet <hi>Aeschylus,</hi> which King <hi>Demetrius,</hi> surnam'd the <hi>Town-taker,</hi> often alledg'd against Fortune, after he had lost his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;

               <p>But this City was the Mother and charitable Nurse of many other Arts and Sciences, some of which she first invented and illustrated; to others she gave both Efficacy, Honour, and Increase: More especially to her is Painting beholding for its first Invention and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to which it has attain'd. For <hi>Apollodorus</hi> the Painter, who was the first that invented the heightning and softning of Shadows, was an <hi>Athenian.</hi> Over whose Works there is this Inscription,
<q>
                     <l>'Tis no hard thing to reprehend me,</l>
                     <l>But let the Men that blame me, mend me.</l>
                  </q> Then for <hi>Euphranor, Nikias, Aschepiodorus,</hi> and <hi>Plestaenelus</hi> the Brother of <hi>Phidias,</hi> some of them painted the Victories, others the Battles of Great Generals, and some of them the <hi>Hero</hi>'s themselves. Thus <hi>Euphranor,</hi> comparing his
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:46328:195"/> own <hi>Theseus</hi> with another drawn by <hi>Parrhasius,</hi> said that <hi>Parrhasius</hi>'s <hi>Theseus</hi> eat Roses, but his fed upon Beef. For indeed <hi>Parrhasius</hi>'s <hi>Piece</hi> was somewhat softly and effeminately painted, and perhaps it might be something like the Original. But he that beheld <hi>Euphranor</hi>'s <hi>Theseus,</hi> might well say,
<q>

                  <hi>Euphranor</hi> also painted the Battle of <hi>Mantinea</hi> fought by the Cavalry between the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas.</hi> The Story was thus. The <hi>Theban Epaminondas,</hi> pufft up with his Victory at <hi>Leuctrae,</hi> and designing to insult and trample over falling <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the Glory of that City, with an Army of Seventy Thousand Men, invaded and laid waste the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, stirr'd up the Neighbouring Cities to revolt, and not far from <hi>Mantinea</hi> provok'd the <hi>Spartans</hi> to Battle; but they neither being willing, nor indeed daring to incounter him, being in expectations of a reinforcement from <hi>Athens, Epaminondas</hi> disl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o send Relief to <hi>Sparta,</hi> presently Commanded the <hi>Thebans</hi> to prepare to storm the Town. As soon, the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who had a great Conceit of their Warlike Furniture, took their several Posts and began to surround the City.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46328:195"/> This put the <hi>Mantineans</hi> into a dismal Consternation, and fill'd the whole City with dreadful Outcries and Hurly-burly, as being neither able to withstand such a Torrent of armed Men ready to rush in upon them, nor having any hopes of Succor.</p>
               <p>But at the same time and by good Fortune, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> came down from the Hills into the Plains of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> not knowing any thing of the Critical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that requir'd more speedy haste, but marching lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely along. However so soon as they were inform'd of the danger of their Allies by one that scouted out from the rest, tho but few in respect of the number of their Enemies, single of themselves, and tir'd with their March; yet they presently drew up into Battalia, and the Cavalry charging up to the very Gates of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinea,</hi> there happen'd a terrible Battle between the Horse on both sides, wherein the <hi>Athenians</hi> got the better; and so sav'd <hi>Mantinea</hi> out of <hi>Epaminondas</hi>'s Hands. This Conflict was painted by <hi>Euphranor,</hi> and you see in the Picture with what strength, what fury and vigor they fought. And yet I do not believe that any one will compare the Judgment of the Painter with that of the General; or would endure that any one should prefer the <hi>Picture</hi> before the <hi>Trophic,</hi> or the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation before the Truth it self. Though indeed, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> calls Painting silent Poetry, and Poetry, Speaking Painting. For those Actions which Painters set forth as they were doing, those History relates as they were done. And what the one sets forth in Colours and Figures, the other relates in Words and Sentences; only they differ in the Materials and manner of Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. However both aim at the same end, and he is accompted the best Historian who can make the most lively Descriptions both of Persons and Passions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Thucydides</hi> always drives at this Perspicuity, to make the Hearer as it were a Spectator, and to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:46328:196"/> the same Passions and Perturbations of Mind into his Readers, as they were in, that beheld the Causes of those Effects. For <hi>Demosthenes</hi> embattelling the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> near the Rocky-shoar of <hi>Pyla, Brasidas</hi> hastning the Pilot to put out to Sea; then going to the Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers-seats, wounded, fainting, and leaning on that part of the Vessel where the Oars could not trouble him; the Land-Fight of the <hi>Spartans</hi> from the Sea, and the Sea-Engagement of the <hi>Athenians</hi> from the Land; then again in the <hi>Sicilian-War,</hi> both a Land-Fight and Sea-Engagement, so fought that neither had the better; all these things are so lively and sensibly describ'd, that the Reader feels almost the same Motions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Body, as if he had been present and beheld the Actions themselves. So that if we may not compare Painters with Generals, neither must we equal Historians to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thersippus</hi> the <hi>Eroensian,</hi> brought the first News of the Victory at <hi>Marathon,</hi> as <hi>Heraclides</hi> of <hi>Pontus</hi> relates. But most report, that <hi>Eucles</hi> running Armed with his Wounds reeking from the Fight, and falling through the Door into the first House he met, expir'd with only these Words in his Mouth, <hi>God save ye, we are well.</hi> Now this Man brought the News himself of the success of a Fight wherein he was present in Person. But suppose that any of the Goat-keepers or Herds-men had beheld the Combat from some High-hill, at a distance, and seeing the success of that great Atcheivment, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than by Words can be exprest, should have come to the City, without any Wound or Blood about him, and should have claim'd the Honours done to <hi>Cynegyrus, Callimachus,</hi> and <hi>Polyzetus,</hi> for giving an Accompt of their Wounds, their Bravery, and Deaths, wouldst thou not have thought him Impudent above Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it self? Seeing that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> gave the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46328:196"/> that brought the News of the Victory at <hi>Mantinea,</hi> no other reward, then a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Victuals from the<note n="*" place="margin">Place where the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> banqueted in public with great Parci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Frugality.</note>
                  <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> But Historians are, as it were, well voic'd Relators of the Actions of Great Men, who add Grace and Beauty, and Dint of wit to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and to whom they that first light upon them and read them, are indebted for their pleasing Tydings. And being read, they are applauded for transmitting to Posterity the Actions of those that do bravely. For Words do not make Actions, though we give them the Hearing. But there is a certain Grace and Glory in the Compiling Part when it resembles the Grandeur of the Actions themselves. According to that of <hi>Homer,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>And many Falsities he did unf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ld</l>
                     <l>That look'd like Truths, so smoothly were they told.</l>
                  </q> It is reported also, that when one of his Familiar Friends should say to <hi>Menander, The Feasts of Bacchus are at hand, and thou hast made ne'er a Comedy,</hi> he made him this Answer, by all the Gods I have made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, for I have laid my Plot; and there remains on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make the Verses and Measures to it. So that the Poets themselves believe the Actions to be more necessary then the Words, and the first things to be considered. <hi>Corinna</hi> likewise, when <hi>Pindar</hi> was but a Young Man, and made too daring a use of his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, gave him this Admonition, that he was no Poet, for that he never compos'd any fables, which was the cheifest Office of Poetry. In regard that Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, Figures, Metaphors, Songs, and Measures were invented to give a sweetness to Things. Which Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition <hi>Pindar</hi> laying up in his Mind, wrote a certain Ode which thus begins,
<q>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:46328:197"/>
                     <l>Shall I <hi>Ismenus</hi> Sing,</l>
                     <l>Or <hi>Melia,</hi> that from Spindles all of Gold</l>
                     <l>Her twisted Yarn unwinds,</l>
                     <l>Or <hi>Cadmus</hi> that most ancient King,</l>
                     <l>Or else the sacred Race of Spartans Bold,</l>
                     <l>Or <hi>Hercules</hi> that far in Strength transcends.</l>
                  </q> Which when he shew'd to <hi>Corinna,</hi> with a smile, when you sow, said she, you must scatter the Seed with your hand, not empty the whole Sack at once. And indeed we find that <hi>Pindar</hi> intermixes in his Poetic Numbers a Collection of all sorts of Fables. Now that Poetry employs it self in Mythology is agreed by <hi>Plato</hi> likewise. For a Fable is the Relation of a false Story resembling Truth; and therefore very remote from real Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for relation is the Image of Action, as Fable is the Image of Relation. And therefore they that feign Actions, are as different from Historians, as they that speak differ from those that act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athens</hi> therefore never bred up any true Artist in Poetry or Lyric Verse. For <hi>Cnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now for the Dramatic Poets, some of them lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Comedy to be so ignoble, and troublesom, that the <hi>Areopagites</hi> publish'd a Law that no Man should make any Comedies. But <hi>Tragedy</hi> flourish'd, and was cry'd up, and with wonder and admiration heard and beheld by all People in those days, deceiving them with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and the display of various Passions; whereby, as <hi>Gorgias</hi> says, he that deceiv'd, was more just then the Deceiver; and he that was deceiv'd, wiser then he who was deceiv'd. He that deceiv'd was more just
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:46328:197"/> because it was no more then what he pretended to do: And he that was deceiv'd was wiser; for that he must be a Man of no Sence, that is not taken with the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Words. And yet what Benefit did those fine Tragedys procure the <hi>Athenians?</hi> But the shrewdness and cunning of <hi>Themistocles</hi> wall'd the City; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of <hi>Pericles</hi> adorn'd their Arsenal, and <hi>Cimon</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd them to command their Neighbors. But as for the Wisdom of <hi>Euripides,</hi> the Eloquence of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> the Lofty Stile of <hi>Eschylus,</hi> what calamity did they avert from the City? Or what renown or Fame did they bring to the <hi>Athenians?</hi> Is it fitting that Dramatic Poems should be compar'd with Trophies, or Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stic Discipline with Noble Atcheivments? Would ye that we should introduce the Men themselves carrying before them the Marks and Signals of their own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, permitting them double entrance like the Actors upon the Stage? But then it would be requisite that the Poets should go before them, saying and singing, A <hi>Panegyric, Gentlemen, Curious Words,</hi> give way to us whoever he be that understands not Encomiums of this Nature, that has not a pure Tongue, that never Sang the Orgies of the High-born Muses, nor ever officiated at the Bacchanals of the Bull devouring Deity. And then there must be Scenes, and Vizards, and Altars and Versatil Machines. There must be also the Tragedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Actors, the <hi>Nicostrati, Callipidae, Mnescisci, Theodori, Poli,</hi> the Dressers, and Sedan-men of Tragedy, like those of some sumptuously apparell'd Lady, or rather like the Painters, Guilders, and Colourers of Statues; together with a costly preparation of Vessels, Vizards, Purple-Coats, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, attended by an unruly Rabble of Dancers and Guards; which a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> once beholding, not improperly said he, <hi>how</hi> strangely are the <hi>Athenians</hi> mistaken, consuming so much cost and labour upon Ridiculous Trif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:46328:198"/> of Navies, and Victualing whole Armies upon the Stage. For if you compute the cost of those Dramatic Preparations, you will find that the <hi>Athenians</hi> spent more upon their <hi>Bacchae, Oidipodae, Antigones, Medeas,</hi> and <hi>Electras,</hi> then in their Wars against the <hi>Barbarians</hi> for Liberty, and extending their Empire. For their Generals oft-times led forth the Souldiers to Battle, commanding them only to make Provision of such Food, as needed not the tedious preparation of Fire. And indeed their Admiral and Captains of their Ships went a Board without any other Provision then Meal, Onyons and Cheese. Whereas the Masters of the <hi>Chorus's,</hi> feeding their Dancers with Eeles, Lettice, the Kernels of Garlic, and Marrow, feasted for a a long time, exercising their Voices and pleasing their Palates by turns. And as for these if they were overcome, it was their misfortune to be contemn'd and hist'd at. And for the Victors, there was neither <hi>Tripos,</hi> nor consecrated Ornament of Victory, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> calls it, but a life prolong'd among Cables, and an empty House for a Tomb. For this is the Tribute of Poetry, and there is nothing more splendid to be expected from it.</p>
               <p>Now then let us consider the Great Generals going thither, to whom so soon as they pass by us, we must rise up and pay our Salutations, especially those who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But as for the Writings of the Poets they are meer baubles. But Rhetoricians and Orators indeed have something in them that renders them in some measure fit to be compar'd with great Captains. For which reason. <hi>Aeschines</hi> deriding <hi>Demosthenes</hi> is reported to have said of him, that he had commenc'd a Suit between Oratory and the Art of conducting an Army.

For neither did he spend his Years in whetting his Sword, in grinding and sharpning his Sphear, in scouring and polishing his Helmet; in commanding Navies and Armies, but in knitting and joyning together Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, Adequates, and like Cases, and smoothing and adapting of Periods and Sentences; only that he did not make use of Files, Plainers, or Chizzels. How would that Man have been affrighted at the clattering of Weapons, or the routing of a <hi>Phalanx,</hi> who was so afraid of suffering one Vowel to clash with another, or to pronounce a Word where the Syllables were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even. <hi>Meltiades,</hi> the very next day after the Battle of

                  </q> Consider now the poor Spirit of this great Orator, who spent the ninth part of his Life in compiling one single Oration. But to say no more of him, is it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to compare the Harangues of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> as he was an Orator, with the Martial Exploits of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes,</hi> when a great Leader.

                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:46328:200"/> Or his Declamation against <hi>Amathusius,</hi> concerning <hi>Slaves,</hi> with the noble Service which he perform'd in reducing the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to Slavery. Neither can it be said, because he compos'd an Oration for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Freedom of <hi>Athens</hi> to all that came to inhabit there, that he therefore deserv'd as much honour as <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who made one People of the <hi>Mantineans</hi> and <hi>Elians,</hi> and joyn'd them Confederates with the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> against the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> And yet we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the public Orations of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Applause, and particularly his <hi>Philippies,</hi> in which he bravely encourages the <hi>Athenians</hi> to take Arms, and extols the Enterprize of <hi>Leptines.</hi>

                  <hi>PLATO</hi> in his Laws permits not any one to go and draw Water from his Neighbors Well, who has not first digg'd and sunk a Pit in his own Ground, till he is come to a Vein of Clay, and has by his sounding experimented, that the Place will not yield a Spring, because the Clay or Potters Earth, being of its own Nature, fatty, solid, and strong, retains the Moisture, it receives, and will not let it soak or pierce thrÃ´: But it must be lawful for them to take Water from anothers Ground, when there is no Way or Means for them, to find any in their own: for the Law ought to provide for Mens Necessity, but not favor their Laziness. The like Ordinance there should be also concerning Money: That none should be allow'd to borrow upon Usury, nor to go and dive into other Mens Purses, as it were into their Wells and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, before they have first searcht at home, and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every Means for the obtaining it, having collected, as it were, and gather'd together all the Gutters and Springs, to try, if they can draw from them, what may suffice to supply their most necessary Occasions.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:46328:201"/> But on the contrary many there are, who, to defray their idle Expences, and to satisfy their extravagant and superfluous Delights, make not use of their own, but have recourse to others, running themselves deeply into Debt without any Necessity. Now this may easily be judg'd, if one does but consider, that Usurers do not ordinarily lend to those, which are in Distress; but only to such, as desire to obtain and get somewhat, that is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, and of which they stand not in need: so that the Credit, given by the Lender, is a Testimony, sufficiently proving, that the Borrower has of his own; whereas on the contrary, since he has of his own, he ought to keep himself from bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Why shouldst thou go and make thy Court to a Banker or a Merchant? Borrow from thine own Table. Thou hast Tankards, Dishes, and Basins of Silver: make use of them for thy Necessity, and, when they are gone to supply thy Wants, the pleasant Town of <hi>Aulis,</hi> or Isle of <hi>Tenedos</hi> will again refurnish thy Board with fair Vessels of Earth, far more cleanly and neat than those of Silver: for they are not scented with the strong and unpleasant Smell of Usury, which like Rust, daily more and more sullies and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes the Lustre of thy Sumptuous Magnificence: they will not be every day putting thee in mind of the Calends, and new Moons, which being of themselves the most holy and sacred Days of the Months, are by reason of Usuries rendred the most odious and accurs'd. For as to those, who choose rather to carry their Goods to the Brokers, and there lay them in pawn for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, taken upon Usury, than to sell them outright, I do not believe, that <hi>Jupiter Ctesius</hi> himself can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them from Beggary. They are asham'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth to receive the full Price and Value of their Goods; but they are not asham'd to pay Use for the Money, they have borrow'd on them. And yet the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:46328:202"/> great and wise <hi>Pericles</hi> caus'd that costly Robe of fine Gold, weighing about forty Talents, with which <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi>'s Statue was adorn'd, to be made in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he could take it on and off at his Pleasure; <hi>To the end,</hi> said he, <hi>that when we shall stand in need of Money to support the Charges of an expensive War, we may take it, and make use of it on so weighty an Occasion, putting again afterwards in its place ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of no less Price and Value than the former.</hi> Thus ought we in our Affairs, as in a besieged Town, never to admit or receive the hostile Garrison of an Usurer, nor to endure before our Eyes the Delivering up of our Goods into perpetual Servitude; but rather to cut off from our Table, what is neither necessary nor profitable, and in like manner from our Beds, our Couches, and our ordinary Expences, so to keep our selves free and at Liberty, in hopes to restore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what we shall have retrench'd, if Fortune shall hereafter smile upon us. The <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies heretofore willingly parted with their Jewels and Ornaments of Gold for the making a Cup, to be sent as an Offering to the Temple of <hi>Apollo Pythius</hi> in the City of <hi>Delphi.</hi> And the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Matrons did with their own Hands cut the Hair from their Heads, to make Cords for the managing of their Warlike Engins and Instruments in defence of their besieged City. But we, as if we were asham'd of being able to stand on our own Legs, and without being supported by the Assistance of others, go and enslave our selves by Engagements and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations; whereas it were much better, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining our Humor, and confining it, to what is profitable for us, we should of our Plate, which we should either melt, or sell, build a Temple of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for our selves, our Wives, and our Children.</p>

               <p>The Goddess <hi>Diana</hi> in the City of <hi>Ephesus</hi> gives to such Debtors, as can fly into her Temple, Freedom and Protection against their Creditors: but the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of Parsimony and Moderation in Expences, into which no Usurer can enter, to pluck thence, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away any Debtor Prisoner, is always open for the Wise, and affords them a long and large Space of joyful and honorable Repose. For as the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess, which gave Oracles in the Temple of the <hi>Pythian Apollo</hi> about the Time of the <hi>Median</hi> Wars, answer'd the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that God had for their Safety given them a Wall of Wood, upon which forsaking their Lands, their City, their Houses, and all their Goods, they had recourse to their Ships for the Preservation of their Liberty: so God gives us a Table of Wood, Vessels of Earth, and Garments of course Cloth, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to live and continue in Freedom:
<q>
                     <l>Aim not at gilded Coaches, Steeds of Price,</l>
                     <l>And Harness, richly wrought with quaint Device.</l>
                  </q> For how swiftly soever they may run, yet will Usuries overtake them, and outrun them.</p>
               <p>Take rather the first Ass, thou shalt meet, or the first Pack-horse, that shall come in thy way, and fly from that cruel and tyrannical Enemy the Usurer, who asks thee not Fire and Water, as heretofore did the barbarous King of <hi>Persia,</hi> but, which is worse, touches thy Liberty, wounds thy Honor by Proscriptions, and sets thy Goods to Sale by Outcry. If thou payst him not, he troubles thee; if thou hast wherewithal to satisfy him, he will not receive it, unless it be his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. If thou sell'st, he will have thy Goods for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or at a very under rate; and if thou wilt not sell, he will force thee to it: If thou suest him, he speaks to thee of an Accommodation; if thou swear'st
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:46328:203"/> to give him Content, he will domineer over thee: If thou goest to his House, to discourse with him, he shuts his Door against thee; if thou stay'st at home, he is always knocking at thy Door, and will never stir from thee. Of what use to the <hi>Athenians</hi> was the Decree of <hi>Solon,</hi> by which he ordain'd, that the Body should not be oblig'd for any publick Debt: for they, who owe, are in Bondage to all Bankers; and not to them alone, (for then there would be no great hurt,) but to their very Slaves, who are proud, insolent, barbarous, and outragious, and in a word exactly such, as <hi>Plato</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the Devils and fiery Executioners to be, who in Hell torment the Souls of the Wicked. For thus do these wretched Usurers make the Court, where Justice is administred, an Hell to the poor Debtors, prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on some, and gnawing them, Vulture-like, to the very Bones, and
<q>Piercing into their Entrals with sharp Beaks;</q> and standing over others, who are, like so many <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taluses,</hi> prohibited by them from tasting the Corn and Fruits of their own Ground, and drinking the Wine of their own Vintage. And as King <hi>Darius</hi> sent to the City of <hi>Athens</hi> his Lieutenants <hi>Datis</hi> and <hi>Artaphernes</hi> with Chains and Cords, to bind the Prisoners, they should take: so these Usurers, bringing into <hi>Greece</hi> Boxes, full of Schedules, Bills, and Obligatory Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, as so many Irons and Fetters for the Shackling of poor Criminals, go thrÃ´ the Cities, sowing in them, as they pass, not good and profitable Seed, as did heretofore <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> when he went thrÃ´ all Places, teaching the People to sow Corn; but Roots and Grains of Debts, that produce infinite Labors and intolerable Usuries, of which the End can never be found, and which, eating their way, and spreading their Sprouts
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:46328:203"/> round about, do in fine make Cities bend under the Burden, till they come to be suffocated. They say, that Hares at the same time suckle one young Leveret, are ready to kinnle and bring forth another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a third: But the Usuries of these barbarous and wicked Usurers bring forth, before they conceive: for at the very Delivery of their Money they immediatly ask it back, taking it up at the same moment, they lay it down, and letting out that again to Interest, which they take and receive for the Use of what they had lent. 'Tis a Saying among the <hi>Messenians:</hi>
                  <q>Gate before Gat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, and still a Gate behind:</q> But it may much better be said against the Usurers:
<q>Æ²se before Æ²se, and still more Æ²se you'l find.</q> So that they laugh at those natural Philosophers, who hold, that Nothing can be made of Nothing, and of that, which has no Existence: for with them Usury is made and engendred of that, which neither is, nor ever was. They think the Taking to farm the Customs and other public Tributes, which the Laws nevertheless permit, to be a Shame and Reproach: and yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the contrary, in opposition to all the Laws in the World, make Men pay Tribute for what they lend upon Interest, or rather, if Truth may be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, do in the very letting out their Money to Use basely deceive their Debtor: for the poor Debtor, who receives less, than he acknowledges in his Obligation, is falsely and dishonestly cheated. And the <hi>Persians</hi> indeed repute Lying to be a Sin only in a second Degree, but the first they repute to be in debt: forasmuch as Lying fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attends those, that owe. Now there are not in the whole World any People, who are oftner guilty of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:46328:204"/> Lying, than Usurers, nor that practice more Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in their Day-books, in which they set down, that they have deliver'd such a Sum of Money to such a Person, to whom they have not given nigh so much. And the moving Cause of their Lying is pure Avarice, not Want, or Poverty, but an insatiable Desire of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways having more, the End of which is neither pleasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor profitable to themselves, but ruinous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to those, whom they injure. For they neither cultivate the Lands, of which they deprive their Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor inhabit the Houses, out of which they eject them, nor eat at the Tables, which they take away from them, nor wear the Clothes, of which they strip them. But first one is destroy'd, and then a second soon follows, being drawn on, and allur'd by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For the Mischief spreads like Wild-fire, still consuming, and yet still increasing by the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Ruine of those, that fall into it, whom it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours one after another. And the Usurer, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains this Fire, blowing and kindling it to the Undoing of so many People, reaps no other Advantage from it, but only that he now and then takes his Book of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and reads in it, how many poor Debtors he has caus'd to sell, what they had; how many he has dispossess'd of their Lands and Livings; whence he came, and whither he is gone by always turning, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and encreasing his Money.</p>
               <p>Think not, that I speak this for any Ill Will or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that I have sworn against Usurers:
<q>
                     <l>For never did they drive away my Kine,</l>
                     <l>Or Horses.â€”</l>
                  </q> But my only Aim is, to shew those, who are so ready to take up Money upon Use, how much Shame and Slavery there is in it, and how it proceeds only from
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:46328:204"/> extream Folly, Sloth, and Effeminacy of Heart. For if thou hast of thine own, borrow not, since thou hast no need of it; and if thou hast nothing, borrow not, because thou wilt not have any Means to pay. But let us consider the one and the other apart. The el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Cato</hi> said to a certain Old Man, who behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self ill: <hi>My Friend, seeing old Age has of it self so many Evils, why doest thou go about to add to them the Reproach and Shame of Wickedness?</hi> In like manner may we say to a Man, oppress'd with Poverty: <hi>Since Poverty has of it self so many and so great Miseries, do not heap upon them the Anguishes of borrowing and being in debt. Take not from Poverty the only good thing, in which it is superior to Riches, to wit, Freedom from pensive Care.</hi> Otherwise thou wilt subject thy self to the Derision of the common Proverb, which says:
<q>
                     <l>A Goat I cannot bear away,</l>
                     <l>Yet you an Ox upon me lay.</l>
                  </q> Thou canst not bear Poverty, and yet thou art going to load on thy self an Usurer, which is a Burden, even to a Rich Man insupportable.</p>
               <p>But you will say perhaps, How then would you have me to live? Is this a Question, fit for thee to ask, who hast Hands, Feet, and a Voice, who in brief art a Man, whose Property it is to love, and be belov'd, to do, and receive a Courtesy? Canst thou not teach Grammar, bring up young Children, be a Porter or Door-keeper, travel by Sea, serve in a Ship? There is in all these nothing more shameful or odious, than to be dunn'd with the importunate Clamors of such, as are always saying: <hi>Pay me, give me my Money.

For what need was there of bringing in here <hi>Jupiter</hi> the <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he might have given him the same Admonition by things, that were familiar, and before his Eyes? Swallows run not themselves into Debt, Ants borrow not upon Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and yet Nature has given them neither Reason, Hands, nor Art. But she has endu'd Men with such Abundance of Understanding, that they maintain not only themselves, but also Horses, Dogs, Partridges, Hares, and Jays. Why then doest thou condemn thy self, as if thou wert less able to perswade than a Jay, more dumb than a Partridge, and more ungenerous than a Dog, in that thou canst not oblige any Man to be assistant to thee either by serving him, instructing him, delighting him, guarding him, or sighting in his Defence? Doest thou not see, how many occasions the Land, and how many the Sea affords thee for thy Maintenance? Hear also, what <hi>Crates</hi> says:

Yes Sir,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Cleanthes, I still grind, and that I do to gain my Living, and not to depart from Philosophy.</hi> How great and generous was the Courage of this Man, who, coming from the Mill and the Kneading
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:46328:205"/> Trough, did with the same Hand, which had been employ'd in turning the Stone, and moulding the Dough, write of the Nature of the Gods, Moon, Stars, and Sun! And yet we think these to be servile Works.</p>
               <p>Therefore, forsooth, that we may be free, we take up Money at Interest, and to this purpose slatter base and servile Persons, wait on them, treat them, make them Presents, and pay them Pensions, and this we do, not being compell'd by Poverty; (for no Usurer will lend a poor Man Money) but to gratify our Prodigality. For if we would be content with such things, as are necessary for human Life, Usurers would be no less rare in the World, than <hi>Centaurs</hi> and <hi>Gorgons.</hi> But Luxury and Excess, as it produc'd Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths, Silversmiths, Perfumers, and Diers of curious Colors, so has it also brought forth Usurers. For we run not into Debt for Bread and Wine, but for the purchasing of Stately Seats, numerous Slaves, fine Mules, costly Hangings, rich Tables, and for all those foolish and superfluous Expences, to which we frequently put our selves for the exhibiting of Plays to the People, or some such vain Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from which we frequently reap no other Fruit but Ingratitude. Now he, that is once intangled in Usury remains a Debtor all his Life, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in this to the Horse, who, having once taken the Bridle into his Mouth, and the Saddle on his Back, receives one Rider after another. Nor is there any Means for these Debtors to make their Escape in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those fair Pastures and Meadows, which once they enjoy'd, but they wander about, like those Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, mention'd by <hi>Empeducles</hi> to have been driven out of Heaven by the offended Gods:

                  </q> In like manner do such Men fall from the Hand of one Usurer or Banker to another, sometimes of a <hi>Corinthian,</hi> sometimes of a <hi>Patrian,</hi> sometimes of an <hi>Athenian,</hi> till having been deceiv'd and cheated by all, they finally find themselves dissipated and torn in pieces by Usury. For as He, who is fallen into the Dirt, must either rise up and get out of it, or else ly still in the Place, into which he first fell, for that by tumbling, turning, and rolling about, he does but still more and more bemire himself: so also those, who do but change their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and cause their Names to be transcrib'd from one Usurers Book to anothers, do by loading and embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves with new Usuries, become more and more oppress'd. Now in this they properly resemble Persons, distemper'd with Choler, who will not receive any Medicine, sufficient to work a perfect Cure; but are continually taking away that, which drops from the cholerick Humor, and so make way for it to gather more and more: For in the same manner these Men are not willing to be cleans'd at once, but do with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Anguish and Sorrow pay their Use at every Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Year, and no sooner have they discharg'd one, but another drops and stills immediately after, which causes them both aking Hearts and Heads; whereas they should have taken care to get wholly clear, that they might remain free and at Liberty.</p>
               <p>For I now turn my Speech to those, who are more wealthy, and withal more nice and effeminate, and whose Discourse is commonly in this manner: <hi>How, shall I remain then without Servants, without Fire, and

Would you have me become slender, lean and empty?</hi> And why not, provided you thereby get your Health? Thus 'tis better, you should be without Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, than that you should your self become a Slave; and that you should remain without Possessions, than that you should be made the Possession of another. Give Ear a little to the Discourse of the two Vultures, as it is reported in the Fables. One of them was taken with so strong a Fit of Vomiting, that he said: <hi>I believe, I shall cast up my very Bowels.</hi> Now to this his Companion answer'd: <hi>What hurt will there be in it? For thou wilt not indeed throw up thine own Entrals, but those of a deceas'd Person, which we devour'd the other Day.</hi> So he, who is indebted, sells not his own Inheritance, nor his own House, but that of the Usurer, who lent him the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to whom the Law judges the Right and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. <hi>Nay, by</hi> Jupiter, will he say to me, <hi>but my Father left me this Estate.</hi> I believe it well, but he left thee also Liberty and a good Repute, of which thou oughtst to make more Account, and be more careful. He, who begat thee, made thy Foot, and thy Hand, and nevertheless, if they happen to be mortify'd, thou wilt give Money to the Chirurgion to cut them off. <hi>Calypso</hi> presented <hi>Æ²lysses</hi> with a Robe, breathing forth the sweet-scented Odor of an immortal Body, which she put on him, as a Token and Memorial of the Love, she had born him. But when his Ship was cast away, and himself ready to sink to the Bottom, not being able to keep above the Water, by reason of his wet Robe, which weigh'd him downwards, he put it off, and threw it away, and having girt his naked Breast with a certain broad Swadling-band,

                  <hi>Crates</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> Philosopher acted far otherwise: for owing nothing, and consequently not being press'd for Payment by any Creditor, but only tir'd with the Cares and Troubles of House-keeping, and the Sollicitude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to the Management of his Estate, he left a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of eight Talents Value, and taking only his Cloak and Wallet, retir'd to Philosophy and Poverty. <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agoras</hi> also forsook his plentiful and well-stockt Pastures.

               <p>WHat is the Reason, that <hi>Socrates</hi> his God bid him to act the Mid-wife's Part to others, but charged himself not to generate?

There are many (dear Friend) so well affected towards me, that they are ready to fall rudely upon me, when I offer to cure them of the least Madness: for they will not be perswaded that I do it out of good Will, because they are ignorant, that God bears ill Will to no Man, and that therefore I wish Ill to no Man; but to stand in a Ly, or to stifle the Truth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these things I can do.

                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:46328:208"/> whereby as he was interrogating others, he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of Pride, Error and Ignorance, things that made them troublesome both to themselves and others. For about that time there happened to be in <hi>Greece</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sophisters, to these some young Men paid great Sums of Money, for which they purchased a strong O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Learning and Wisdom, and of being stout Disputants; but this sort of Disputation spent much time in trifling Squablings, which neither were of any Credit or Profit. Now <hi>Socrates</hi> using an argumentative Discourse, by way of a purgative Remedy, procured Belief and Authority to what he said; because in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing others, he himself affirmed nothing; and he the sooner gained upon People, because he seemed rather to be inquisitive after the Truth, as well as they, than to maintain his own Opinion: for that useful thing, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is taken with Familiarity, and the Lover is blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the thing loved; and nothing of a Man's own is so beloved, as is his Opinion, and Discourse by him that made it: And the Distribution of Children, said to be the justest, in respect of Discourses, is the unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; for there a Man must take his own; but here a Man must chuse the best, thÃ´ it be another Man's. Therefore he that has Children of his own, is a worse Judge of other Mens: it being true, as the Sophister said well, <hi>The</hi> Eleans <hi>would be the most proper Judges of the Olympick Games, were no</hi> Eleans <hi>Gamesters.</hi> So he that would Judge of Disputations, cannot be just, if he either seeks the Bays for, or is himself Antagonist to either of the Antagonists. For as the <hi>Graecian</hi> Captains, when they were to give their Suffrages, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himself the best, every Man of them voted for himself: so there is not a Philosopher of them all, but would do the like, besides <hi>Socrates,</hi> and those, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, they can say nothing, that is their own; and these only are the pure and incorrupt Judges of the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:46328:209"/> Truth. For as the Air in the Ears, unless it be still, and void of Noise in it self, without any Sound or Tingling, does not exactly take Sounds. So the Philosophical Judgment in Disputations, if it be disturbed and obstre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous within, is hardly comprehensive of what is said without. For our Familiar and inbred Opinion must have Philosophy to rectifie the best things it is capable to do; all others err from the Truth. Furthermore, if Men can comprehend and know nothing, God did just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interdict <hi>Socrates</hi> the Procreation of false and unstable Discourses, which are like Wind-eggs, and bid him convince others who were of any other Opinion. And Reasoning, which rids us of the greatest of Evils, Error and Vanity of Mind, is none of the least Benefits to us: <hi>For God has not granted this to the</hi> Aesculapians: Nor did <hi>Socrates</hi> give Physick to the Body, indeed he purged the Mind of secret Corruption. But if there be any Knowledge of the Truth, and if the Truth be one, he has as much that learns it of him that invented it not, as the Inventer himself. Now, he the most easily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Truth, that is perswaded he has it not, and he chuses best, just as he that has no Children of his own, adopts the best. Mark this well, that PoÃ«try, Mathematicks, Oratory, and Sophistry, which are the things the Deity forbad <hi>Socrates</hi> to generate, are of no Value; and that of the sole Wisdom about what is Divine and Intelligible (which <hi>Socrates</hi> call'd Amiable and Eligible for it self) there is neither Generation nor Invention by Man, but Reminiscence. Wherefore <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> taught nothing, but suggesting Principles of doubt, as Birth-pains, to young Men, he excited, and at the same time confirmed the innate Notions: This he called his <hi>Art of Midwifry,</hi> which did not (as others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed) extrinsecally confer Intelligence upon his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; but demonstrated it to be inna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Why does he call the supreme God <hi>Father and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things?</hi> Is he (as <hi>Homer</hi> calls him) of created Gods, and Men the Father, and of Brutes and things that have no Soul the Maker? If <hi>Chrysippus</hi> may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, he cannot be said to be Father of the Field, who scattered the Seed in it, thÃ´ Corn grow from that Seed; he only, as his way is, used a Metaphor, and called the Cause of the World the Father of it: As in his <hi>Convivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> he calls <hi>Phaedrus</hi> the Father of the amatorious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which he had introduced, and as in his <hi>Phaedrus</hi> he calls <hi>Lycias,</hi> who had been the occasion of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Discourse about Philosophical Matters. Or is there any difference between a Father and a Maker, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Procreation and Making? For, as what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created is also made, but not on the contrary; so he that procreated did also make: for the Procreation of an Animal, is the making of it. Now the Work of a Maker, as of a Builder, a Weaver, a musical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Maker, or a Statuary, does altogether differ from its Author; but the Principle and Power of the Procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is implanted in the Progeny, and contains his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Progeny being a Piece pull'd off the Procreator. Since therefore, that the World is neither like a piece of Potter's Work, nor Joyner's Work, but that there is a great Share of Life and Divinity in it, which God from himself communicated to, and mixed with Matter, God may as well be called Father of the World, it having Life in it, as the Maker of it.

                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:46328:210"/> him, not only made by him, but begot by him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Republick Universal, suppose the Universe, as one Line, to be cut into two unequal Sections, again cut each of these Sections in two after the same manner: Suppose this to constitute the <hi>Genera</hi> of things sensible, and of things intelligible in the Universe, the first repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the <hi>Genus</hi> of Intelligibles, comprehending the first <hi>Species;</hi> the second the Mathematicks. Of Sensibles, first the <hi>Genus</hi> comprehends solid Bodies, the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the Images and Representations of them. Moreover, to every one of these four he has assigned its proper judicatory Faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> to the first the Mind; to the Mathematicks the Intellect; to Sensibles Belief; to Images and Representations Likelihood and Probability. But what does he mean by dividing the Universe into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Parts? And which of the Sections, the Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or the Sensible, is the greater? For in this he has not explain'd himself. But it appears, the Sensible is the greater Portion. For the Essence of Intelligibles is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, and in the same respect ever the same, being contracted into a little and pure; but an Essence divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and running about Bodies, constitutes the sensible part. Now, what is immaterial is limited; but Body in respect of Matter is infinite and unlimited, and as it is sensible it partakes of Intelligible, when it is defined. Besides, as every Sensible has many Images, Shadows and Representations, and from one and the same Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal several Copies may be taken both by Nature and Art; so the former must needs exceed the latter in Number, according to <hi>Plato,</hi> who makes the Notions of things sensible to be Copies or Ideas, like Statues or Pictures of things material. Then the Mind conceives one sort of Ideas abstracted from Body, which belongs to the Mathematicks: This leads from Arithmetick to Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, thence to Astrology, then to Musick or Harmony. For things became Geometrical by the Accession of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:46328:210"/> Magnitude to Quantity; Solid by the Accession of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity to Magnitude; Astrological by the Accession of Motion to Solidity; Harmonical by the Accession of Sound to Motion. Abstract then Sound from Motion, Motion from Solids, Profundity from <hi>Superficies,</hi> Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude from Quantity, we are then in notional Ideas, which have no Distinction among themselves, in respect of Unity and Solitude: For Unity makes no Number, unless joyned by the infinite Binary, then it makes a Number: And thence we proceed to Points, thence to Lines, from them to <hi>Superficies,</hi> and Profundities, and Bodies, and to the Qualities of Bodies so and so qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now, the Mind is the only judicatory Faculty of Intelligibles, and the Intellect is the Mind in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, as to Intelligibles, appearing by Reflexion in a Glass. But as to the Knowledge of Bodies, because of their Multitude, Nature has given us five Powers or Distinctions of Senses; nor are all Bodies discerned by them, many escaping Sense, by reason of their small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And thÃ´ every one of us consists of a Body and Soul, yet the Hegemonick and intellectual Faculty is small being hid in the huge Mass of Flesh. And the Case is the same in the Universe as to sensible and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible: for Intelligibles are the Principles of bodily things, but every thing is greater than the Principle whence it came. Yet on the contrary some will say, that by comparing Sensibles with Intelligibles, we match things mortal with divine in some measure: for God is in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibles. Besides, the thing contained, is ever less than the Containing, and the Nature of the Universe in the Intelligible contains the Sensible: For God having plac'd the Soul in the middle, hath extended it thrÃ´ all, and hath covered it all round with Bodies. The Soul is invisible, and cannot be perceived by any of the Senses, as <hi>Plato</hi> says in his Book <hi>De Legibus,</hi> therefore every Man must dye, but the World shall never dye.
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:46328:211"/> For Mortality and Dissolution surrounds every one of our vital Faculties. The Case is quite otherwise in the World, for the corporeal Part contained in the middle by the more noble and unalterable Part is ever preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And a Body is not said to be without Parts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible for its minuteness: But what is Incorporeal and Intelligible is so, as being simple and sincere, and void of all Privation and Difference. Otherwise it were Folly to think to judge of corporeal things by incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real. Now a thing is said to be without Parts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible, which is every where, and no part of the World void of it: But all Affections and Actions, and all Corruptions and Generations are contained by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. But the Mind is only Judge of what is intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, as the Sight is of Light, by reason of their Simplicity and Similitude. But Bodies having several Differences and Diversities, are comprehended some by one Judicatory, others by another, as by several Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. Yet they do not well, who despise the <hi>DianoÃ«tick</hi> Faculty in us: For it being great, comprehends all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibles, and attains to things Divine. This must be a great thing, which (as he says in his <hi>Convivium</hi>) shows us, how we should use amatorious Matters, turning our Minds from sensible Goods, to things only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible by the Mind, that we ought not to be enslaved by the Beauty of any Body, Study or Learning; but laying aside such Pusillanimity, we may turn to the vast Ocean of Beauty.</p>
               <p>What is the Reason that, thÃ´ <hi>Plato</hi> always says that the Soul is ancienter than the Body, and that it is the Cause and Principle of its Rise, yet he likewise says, that neither the Soul exists without the Body, nor the Mind without the Soul, but the Soul in the Body, and the Mind in the Soul: for so the Body will seem to be and not to be, because it both exists with the Soul, and is begot by the Soul? Perhaps what we have often said is
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:46328:211"/> true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Soul without Mind, and the Body without Form, did mutually ever co-Ã«xist, and neither of them had Generation or Beginning. But after the Soul did partake of Mind and Harmony, and being through Concent made wise, wrought a Change in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and being stronger than the others Motions, it drew and converted these Motions to it self: so the Body of the World drew its Original from the Soul, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came conformable and like to it. For the Soul did not make the Nature of the Body out of its self, nor out of nothing; but it wrought an orderly and plyable Body out of one disorderly and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Just as if a Man should say, that the Virtue of the Seed is with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and yet that the Body of the Fig-tree or Olive-tree was made of the Seed, he would not be much out (for the Body, its innate Motion and Mutation proceeding from the Seed, grew up and became what it is.) So when formless and indefinite Matter was once formed by the in-being Soul, it received such and such a Form and Disposition.</p>

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:46328:212"/> like Globes of twelve Skins, it becomes circular and comprehensive. For it has twenty solid Angles, each of which is contained by three obtuse Planes, and each of these contains a Right, and the fifth Part of a right Angle. Now it is made up of twelve equilateral and equangular Quinquangles, each of which consists of thirty of the first <hi>Scalena.</hi> Therefore it seems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble both the Zodiack and the Year, it being divided into Parts and Portions alike. Or is a Right in Nature prior to Circumference? Or is Circumference but an Accident of Rectilinear. For a right Line is said to bend, and a Circle is described by a Center and Distance, which is the place of a right Line, by which it is measured: for a Circumference is every where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually distant from the Middle. And a Cone and a Cylinder are made by Rectilinears. A Cone by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one side of a Triangle fixt, and carrying the other round. A Cylinder, by doing the like with a Paralle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logram. Further, that is nearest a Principle which is less; but a Right is the least of all Lines, as it is simple, whereas in a Circumference, one part is concave with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, another convex within. Besides, Numbers are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Figures, as Unity is before a Point, which is Unity in Position. But indeed Unity is a Triangle: for every triangular Number taken eight times, by adding an Unity, becomes quadrate, and this happens to Unity. Therefore a Triangle is before a Circle, and a right Line before a Circumference. Besides, no Element is divided into things compounded of it self; indeed there is a Dissolution of all other things into an Element. Now, a Triangle is divided into no Circumference; but two Diameters cut a Circle into four Triangles. Therefore a Rectilinear Figure is before a Circular, and has more of the Nature of an Element. And <hi>Plato</hi> himself shows that a Rectilinear is in the first place, and a Circular is only consequential and accidental. For where he says,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:46328:212"/> the Earth consists of Cubes, each of which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Rectilinear <hi>Superficies,</hi> he also says the Earth is Spherical and round. Therefore there was no need of making a peculiar Element for round things, since Rectilinears, fitted after a certain manner among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, do make up this Figure. Besides, a right Line whether great or little, preserves the same Rectitude; but the Circumference of a Circle, the less it is, the crookeder it is; the larger, the streighter. Therefore Lines falling on a Convex <hi>Superficies,</hi> some touch the Subject plane in a Point, others in a Line. So that a Man may imagine that a Circumference is made up of little right Lines. But observe this, no Circle or Sphere is exact, and thÃ´ there be a latent Difference in the Station, or Extension, or Minuteness of the Particles, yet it seems circular and round. There ore no corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Body moves circularly, but altogether in a right Line. To be truly Spherical, is not in a sensible Body, that is the Element of the Soul and Mind, to whom he has given circular Motion, as being agreeable to their Nature.</p>
               <p>How comes it to pass, that in <hi>Phaedrus</hi> it is said, that the Nature of a Wing, by which any thing that is heavy is carried upwards, participates most of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of God?

For it seems unreasonable to ascribe the Reason of such different Effects to the self same Cause. How Respiration is made by the <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> of the Air, he has sufficiently shown. But as for the rest, he says, they act miraculously, that nothing stands and how things thrust, and change Postures with others, he has left to us to determine. As to Cupping-glasses, the Case is thus; the Air next to the Flesh being comprehended and inflamed by the Heat, and being made more rare than the Pores of the Glass, does not go into a <hi>Vacuum</hi> (for there is no such thing) but into the Air, which is without the Cupping-glass, and has an Impulse upon it. This Air drives that before it, and as it gives way, succeeds into the place of what was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by the Cession of the last. And so the Air ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the Flesh, comprehended by the Cupping-glass, and being in a Ferment, draws the Humors into the Cupping-glass. For the Cavities about the Mouth and Stomach are full of Air, when therefore the Meat is squeez'd down by the Tongue and Tonsils, the elided Air follows what gives way, and also forces down the Meat. Weights also thrown, cleave the Air, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipate it, as they fall with Force, the Air recoyling back, filling the Vacuity, following the Impulse, and accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Motion. The Fall also of Thunderbolts is like to darting any thing. For by the Blow in the Cloud, the fiery Matter exploded, breaks into the Air, and it being broken, gives way, and being contracted above beyond it self, by main Force it presses the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt downwards, contrary to Nature. And neither Amber nor the Load-stone draws any thing to them,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:46328:213"/> which is near them, nor does any thing spontaneously approach them. But this Stone emits strong Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by which the containing Air being impelled, forceth that before it, and being turned round, and returned to the vacuated place, it forcibly carries about the Iron. In Amber there is a flammeous and spirituous Nature, and this by rubbing on the Surface, being emitted by recluse Passages, does the same that the Loadstone does. It also draws the lightest and driest of adjacent Bodies, by reason of their Tenuity and Weakness; for it is not so strong, nor so endued with Weight and Strength, as to force much Air, and to act with Violence, and to have Power over great Bodies, as the Magnet has. But what is the reason the Air neither draws a Stone nor Wood, but Iron only to the Loadstone? This is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Question both by them who think the Coition of these Bodies is made by the Contraction of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and by such as think it done by the Incitement of the Iron. Iron is neither so rare as Wood, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together so solid as Gold or a Stone, but has certain Pores and Asperities, which in inequality are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Air, and the Air being received in certain Seats, cannot get out, and being comprehended by the Iron moderately resisting, as the Air returning the Stone happens upon it, it draws the Iron along with it to the Stone. And the reason is this. But the manner how the Waters running over the Earth, run against the Wind, is not so evident. But it is observable, that the Waters of Lakes and Ponds stand immoveable, because the Air about them stagnates immoveable, and admits of no Vacuity. For the Water on the Surface of Lakes and Seas, is troubled and fluctuates, as the Air is mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it following the Motion of the Air, and moving as it is moved. For the Force from below causes the Hollowness of the Wave, and from above the Swelling thereof, till the Air ambient, and containing the Water,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:46328:214"/> is still. Therefore the Flux of such Waters, as follow the Motion of the Air, is continued without end. And this is the reason that the Stream encreases with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and is slow, where the Water is weak, the Air not giving way, nor finding greater Resistance. So the Water of Fountains must needs run out, the extrinsick Air succeeding into the Vacuity, and throwing the Water out. In a close House, that keeps in the Air and Wind, the Floor sprinkled with Water causes an Air or Wind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as the sprinkled Water falls, the Air gives way. For it is so provided by Nature, that Air and Water force one another, and give way to one another: because there is no Vacuity where one is, in which the other is not moved. Concerning Symphony, he shows how Sounds harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize. A quick Sound is acute, a slow is grave. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acute Sounds move the Senses quicker, which dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and grave Sounds supervening, what arises from the Contemperation of one with the other, causes Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to the Ear, which we call Harmony. And by what has been said, it may easily be understood, that Air is the Instrument of these things. For Sound is the Stroak upon the Sense of the Hearer, caused by the Air, and the Air strikes, as it is struck by the thing moving; if violent, acutely; if languid, softly. The violent Stroak comes quick to the Ear; then the Circumient Air receiving a slower, it affects and carries the Sense along with it.</p>
               <p>What means <hi>Timaeus,</hi> when he says, that Souls are dispersed into the Earth, the Moon, and into other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Time? Does the Earth move like the Sun, Moon, and five Planets, which for their Motions he calls Organs or Instruments of Time? Or is the Earth fixt to the <hi>Axis</hi> of the Universe, yet not so built as to remain immovable, but to turn and wheel about, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristarchus</hi> and <hi>Seleucus</hi> have shown since; <hi>Aristarchus</hi> only supposing it, <hi>Seleucus</hi> positively asserting it? <hi>Theophrastus</hi>

For it is not once but several times, that he calls the Stars Instruments of Time. As when he says, the Sun was made, as well as other Planets, for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction and Conservation of the Numbers of Time. It is therefore most proper to understand here, the Earth to be an Instrument of Time, not that the Earth is moved, as the Stars are; but that they being carried about it, it standing still makes Sun-set and Sun-rising, by which, the first Measures of Time, Nights and Days are circumscribed. Wherefore he called it the infallible Guard and Artificer of Night and Day. For the Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Dials are Instruments and Measures of Time, not in being moved with the Shadows, but in standing still, they being like the Earth in interposing between the Sun, when it is down, as <hi>Empedocles</hi> says, <hi>That the Earth makes Night by intercepting Light.</hi> This therefore must be <hi>Plato</hi>'s meaning. And so much the rather, if a Man do but consider, that the Sun is not absurdly, nor without probability said to be made for the Distinction of Time, nor the Moon and the rest of the Planets. For as in other respects the Dignity of the Sun is great; so by <hi>Plato</hi> in his Republick, the Sun is called the King and Lord of the whole sensible Nature, as also the Good of the Intelligible. For it is said to be the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of Good, it giving both Being and Apparence
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:46328:215"/> to things visible; as it is from good that things intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible are, and are understood. But that God having such a Nature, and so great Power, should be made for an Instrument of Time, and a sure Measure of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that happens among the Orbs, as they are slow or swift in Motion, seems neither decent, nor highly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. It must therefore be said to such as are startled at these things, that it is their Ignorance, to think that Time is the Measure of Motion, in respect of sooner or later, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls it; or quantity in Motion, as <hi>Speusippus;</hi> or an Interval of Motion, or a certain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as some of the Stoicks define it by an Accident, they not comprehending its Essence and Power, which <hi>Pindar</hi> has not ineptly expressed in these Words, <hi>Time, who surpasses all in the Seats of the Blest.

For Walking without Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, it justly administers all mortal Affairs. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ancients, the Soul is a Number moving it self. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> says that Time and Heaven were co-Ã«xistent, that Motion was before Heaven had Being; but so was not Time. For then there neither was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor Measure, nor Determination; but indefinite Motion, as it were the formless and rude matter of Time. But when Matter was informed with Figures, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Conversions or CircuÃ¯tions, from that came the World; from this, Time. Both are Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, the World of his Essence; Time of his Invisibility in Motion, as in Production God is the World. Therefore they say Heaven and Motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bred together, will perish together, if ever they do
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:46328:215"/> perish. For nothing is generated without Time, nor is any thing intelligible without Eternity, as this endures for ever, and that never dies when once bred. Time therefore having a necessary Connexion and Affinity with Heaven, cannot be called simple Motion, but as it were Motion in Order, having Terms and Periods; whereof, since the Sun is Praefect and Overseer, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, moderate, produce and observe Changes and Seasons, which (according to <hi>Heraclitus</hi>) produce all things, He is CoÃ¤djutor to the governing and chief God, not in trivial and little things, but in the greatest and most momentous Affairs.</p>

                  </gap> of neither of them to govern and lead it. And the most natural place of the irascible Faculty seems to be in the middle of the other two. For it is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Reason to govern, of the irascible Faculty both to govern and be governed, which is obsequious to Reason, and commands the Concupiscent Faculty, when this is disobedient to Reason.

As therefore in a Chariot, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioteer is not midling in Virtue and Power, but one of the Horses is worse than his Guider, and yet better than his Fellow. So in the Soul, <hi>Plato</hi> gives not the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle place to the principal part; but to that Faculty which has less of Reason than the principal part, and more than the Third. This Order also observes the Analogy of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But it may be ridiculous to describe the First, Middle and Last by their Place; since we see <hi>Hypate</hi> highest in the Harp, lowest in the Pipe, and whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you place the <hi>Mese</hi> in the Harp, provided it is tunable, it sounds more acute than <hi>Hypate,</hi> and more grave than <hi>Nete.</hi> Nor does the Eye possess the same place in all Animals; but where-ever it is placed, it is natural for it to see. So a Paedagogue, thÃ´ he goes not formost, but follows behind, is said to lead; like the General of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Army,
<q>
                     <l>Who sometimes fought in Front,</l>
                     <l>And kept Command, thÃ´ he retir'd upon't.</l>
                  </q> But where ever he was, he was first, and chief in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. So in like manner, the Faculties of the Soul are not to be ranged in order of Place or Name, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Power and Analogy. For, that in the Body of Man, Reason is in the highest Place, is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental. But it holds the chief and highest Power, as <hi>Mese</hi> to <hi>Hypate,</hi> in respect of the Concupiscent; as to <hi>Nete,</hi> in respect of the Irascible. Insomuch as it depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and heightens, and in fine, makes a Harmony, by abating what is too much, and by not suffering them to flat and grow dull. For what is moderate and sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrous, is defin'd by Mediocrity. Besides, it is an Imperfection, to make the Mediocrities of the rational Power, which they call <hi>Sacred Beings,</hi> to be in the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. For in Chariots, the best of the Beasts is not in the middle; nor is the Skill of Driving placed in the highest Place; but it is a Mediocrity in the Inequality
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46328:217"/> of the Swiftness and Slowness of the Horses. As the force of Reason takes up the Passions irrationally mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and reducing it to Measure, constitutes a Mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt too much and too little.</p>
               <p>Why said <hi>Plato</hi> that Speech was composed of Nouns and Verbs? For he seems to make no other Parts of Speech but them. Indeed <hi>Homer,</hi> for the Help of Youth, has comprehended them all in one Verse.</p>

                  </gap>, or Speech which is now called <hi>Protasis,</hi> Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, or Sentence; which as soon as a Man speaks, he either speaks true or false. This Speech consists of a Noun and Verb, which Logicians call the Subject and Praedicate. For when we hear this said <hi>Socrates philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizeth,</hi> Socrates <hi>is changed,</hi> requiring nothing more, we say the one is true, the other is false. For very likely in the beginning Men wanted Speech and articulate Voice to enable them to express at once the Passions and the Patients, and the Actions and the Agents. Now, since Actions and Affections are lively expressed by Verbs, and they that act and are affected by Nouns, as he says, these seem to signifie. And one may say, the rest signifie not. For instance, the Groans and Shrieks of Stage-players, and even their Smiles and <hi>Aposiopeses</hi> make their Discourse more emphatick. But they are not so necessary to signifie any thing as a Noun and Verb, they being only ascititious, to vary Speech; just as they vary Letters, who mark Spirits and Quantities upon Letters, these being the Accidents and Differences
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:46328:217"/> of Letters. As the Ancients have made manifest, whom sixteen Letters sufficed to speak and write any thing. Besides, we must observe, that <hi>Plato</hi> says, that Speech is compos'd <hi>of</hi> these, not <hi>by</hi> these: as if a Man should say such a Medicine is compos'd of Wax and <hi>Galbanum,</hi> and another should cavil at it, because Fire and Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils are omitted, without which it cannot be made. Just so we may blame <hi>Plato</hi> for leaving out Conjunctions, Prepositions, and the like. For Speech is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of them; yet by their Means, and not without them, Speech must be compos'd. As, if a Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>beateth,</hi> or <hi>is beaten,</hi> and put <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> to the same, he shows he understands or means something. But let a Man pronounce <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>For,</hi> and no more, none can conceive any Notion of a Body or Matter, and unless such Words as these be uttered with Verbs and Nouns, they are but empty Noise and Chattering: for neither alone, nor joyn'd one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do they signifie any thing. And joyn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found together Conjunctions, Articles, and Prepositions, supposing you would make something of them; yet you will be taken to bable, and not to speak Sense. But when there is a Verb in construction with a Noun, the Result is Speech and Sense. Therefore some do make only these two Parts of Speech. And perhaps <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> was willing to declare himself of this Mind, when he says,

I think I may say it of the Latine Tongue, which is now the universal Language, that it has taken away all Prepositions, saving a few, nor does it use any Articles, unless as Lace and Ornament to Nouns. Nor is it any Wonder, since <hi>Homer,</hi> who in fineness of Epick surpasses all Men, has put Articles only to a few Nouns, like Handles to Cans, or Crests to Helmets.

But there be some, who think, that Conjunctions do not make any thing one, but that they are an enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Dialect, as of the Time when such and such were Magistrates. Moreover, as to the other parts of Speech, a Pronoun is manifestly a sort of Noun; not only because it has Cases alike, but because it naturally makes a proper Declaration of Notions brought from things defined: nor do I know whether he that says <hi>Socrates,</hi> or he that says <hi>This Man,</hi> does more by Name declare the Person. The thing we call a Participle, being a Mixture of a Verb and Noun, is nothing of it self (as are not the common Names of Men and Women) but in construction is put with others; in regard of Tenses belonging to Verbs, in regard of Cases to Nouns.

               </byline>
               <p>MY Design in this Essay is to treat of that <hi>Vertue,</hi> which is called and accounted, <hi>Moral,</hi> and is chiefly distinguished from the <hi>Contemplative</hi> in it's having for the <hi>Matter</hi> thereof, the Passions of the Mind, and for it's <hi>Form,</hi> Right Reason: And herein to consider the nature of it; how it subsists: And whether that Part of the Soul wherein it resides be indued with <hi>Reason,</hi> of it's own, inherent in it self, or whether it participates of that which is foreign; And if the latter; whether after the manner of those things which are mingled with what is better then themselves; or rather as being distinct it self, but yet under the Dominion and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency of another, it may be said to partake of the Power of the <hi>praedominant</hi> Faculty. For that it is possible for <hi>Vertue</hi> to exist and continue altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of Matter and free from all Mixture, I take to be most manifest. But in the first place I conceive
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:46328:220"/> it may be very useful briefly to run over the <hi>Opinions</hi> of other <hi>Philosophers,</hi> not so much for the vanity of giving an Historical Account <hi>thereof,</hi> as that they being premised <hi>Ours</hi> may thence receive the greater Light and be more firmly established.</p>
               <p>To begin then with <hi>Menedemus</hi> of <hi>Eretria</hi> he took away both the <hi>Number</hi> and the <hi>Differences</hi> of <hi>Vertue,</hi> by asserting it to be but <hi>One</hi> although distinguished by several Names; Holding that in the same manner as a <hi>Mortal</hi> and a <hi>Man</hi> are <hi>all One,</hi> so what we call <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> are but <hi>one and the same thing.</hi> As for <hi>Ariston</hi> of <hi>Chio.</hi> He likewise made <hi>Vertue</hi> to be but <hi>One</hi> in Substance and called it <hi>Sanity,</hi> which as it had respect to <hi>This,</hi> or <hi>That</hi> was to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously multiplied and distinguished: Just after the the same manner as if any one should call our <hi>Sight</hi> when applied to any <hi>White</hi> Object by the Name of<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:46328:221"/> the Defence of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Notions do suppose him to mean <hi>Science</hi> by what he calls <hi>Prudence.</hi> But then <hi>Chrysippus</hi> whilst he imagined from every <hi>distinct Quality</hi> a seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and <hi>peculiar Vertue</hi> to be formed, before he was aware <hi>Raised</hi> (as <hi>Plato</hi> has it) <hi>a whole swarm</hi> of <hi>Vertues</hi> never before known or used among the Philosophers, for as from <hi>Brave,</hi> he derived <hi>Bravery;</hi> from <hi>Mild, Mildness;</hi> and from <hi>Just, Justice:</hi> so from <hi>Pleasant</hi> he fetched <hi>Pleasantness;</hi> from <hi>Good Goodness;</hi> from <hi>Grand Grandeur;</hi> and from <hi>Honest, Honesty;</hi> placing these and all kind of dexterous application of Discourse, all kind of Facetiousness of Conversation, and all witty Turns of Expression in the <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Vertues,</hi> thereby over-running <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which requires nothing less, with a multitude of uncouth, absurd and barbarous Terms.</p>
               <p>However all these do commonly agree in this one Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> in supposing <hi>Virtue</hi> to be a certain <hi>Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Faculty</hi> of the <hi>governing</hi> and <hi>directive</hi> part of the <hi>Soul</hi> of which <hi>Reason</hi> is the Cause, or rather to be <hi>Reason</hi> it self, when it consents to what it ought, and is firm and immutable: And they do likewise think <hi>that part</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> which is the <hi>seat</hi> of the <hi>Passions,</hi> and called <hi>Brutal</hi> or <hi>Irrational,</hi> not to be at all <hi>distinct</hi> by any Physical Difference from that which is <hi>Rational,</hi> but that that <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> (which they call <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Directive</hi>) being wholly turned about and changed by it's <hi>Affections,</hi> and by those several <hi>Alterations</hi> which are wrought in it with respect either to <hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> becometh either <hi>Vice</hi> or <hi>Vertue,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing in it self that is really <hi>Brutal</hi> or <hi>Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</hi> But is then called <hi>Brutal</hi> or <hi>Irrational,</hi> when by the over-ruling and prevailing <hi>Violence</hi> of our <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites</hi> it is hurried on to something <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>vicious</hi> against the <hi>Judgment of Reason.</hi> For that, <hi>Passion,</hi> according to them, is nothing else but <hi>depraved</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semperate reason,</hi> that through a perverse and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               </p>
               <p>Now it seems to me, all these <hi>Philosophers</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect strangers to the clearness and truth of this Point, That we <hi>Every one of us</hi> are in reality <hi>Twofold</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound:</hi> For discerning only that <hi>Composition</hi> in us which of the <hi>two</hi> is most evident, namely <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Body;</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. And yet that in the <hi>Soul</hi> it self also there is a certain <hi>Composition</hi> of <hi>two</hi> dissimilar and distinct <hi>Natures,</hi> the <hi>Brutal</hi> Part whereof as <hi>another Body</hi> is necessarily and physically compounded with and conjoyned to <hi>Reason,</hi> was, it should seem, no secret to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himself: As some have guessed from his having introduced the Study of <hi>Musick</hi> amongst his <hi>Scholars,</hi> for the more easie calming and asswaging the <hi>Mind:</hi> as well knowing that <hi>It</hi> is not in every part of it Obedient and Subject to <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> nor indeed by <hi>Reason</hi> only to be recovered and retreived from <hi>Vice,</hi> but requires some other kind of perswasives to cooperate with it, to dispose it to such a temper and gentleness as that it may not be utterly intractable and obstinate to the <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> And <hi>Plato</hi> very strongly and plainly without the least hesitation maintained the <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Æ²niverse</hi> to be neither <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, uniform</hi> nor <hi>uncompounded;</hi> But that being mixed, as it were, and made up of <hi>That which is always the same</hi> and of <hi>That which is otherwise</hi> in <hi>some</hi> places it is continually governed and carried about after an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> manner in <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> powerful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant <hi>Order,</hi> and in <hi>other</hi> places is divided into <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Circles</hi> one contrary to the other, <hi>unsettled</hi> and fortuitous, whence are derived the <hi>Beginnings</hi> and <hi>Generation</hi> of all Things. And so in like manner the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> being a <hi>part</hi> or <hi>portion</hi> of <hi>That</hi> of the <hi>Æ²ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi> and framed upon reasons and proportions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:46328:222"/> to it, cannot be <hi>simple</hi> and all of the <hi>same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but must have <hi>One part</hi> that is <hi>Intelligent</hi> and rational, which naturally ought to have Dominion over a Man: And <hi>Another</hi> which being <hi>Subject</hi> to <hi>Passions, Irrational,</hi> extravagant and unbounded stands in need of <hi>direction</hi> and <hi>restraint.</hi> And <hi>This last</hi> is again sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into <hi>Two other</hi> parts, <hi>One</hi> whereof being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Corporeal</hi> is called <hi>Concupiscible;</hi> and the <hi>Other,</hi> which sometimes taking part with <hi>this,</hi> and sometimes with <hi>Reason</hi> gives respectively to either of them Strength and Vigor, is called <hi>Irascible.</hi> And that which chiefly discovers the <hi>difference</hi> between the <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Other,</hi> are the frequent <hi>Contests</hi> of the <hi>Intellect</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> with <hi>Conoupiscence</hi> and <hi>Anger,</hi> it being the Nature of things that are different amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be often times repugnant and disobedient to what is best of all.</p>
               <p>These Principles at first <hi>Aristotle</hi> seems most to have relyed upon, as plainly enough appears from what he has written: ThÃ´ afterwards he confounded the <hi>Irasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>Concupiscible</hi> together, by joyning the one to the other, as if <hi>Anger</hi> were nothing but a <hi>Thirst</hi> and <hi>Desire</hi> of <hi>Revenge:</hi> However to the last he constantly maintained that the <hi>Sensual</hi> and <hi>Irational</hi> was wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi> part of the <hi>Soul;</hi> not that it is so absolutely devoid of <hi>Reason</hi> neither as those <hi>Faculties</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> which are <hi>Sensative, Nutritive</hi> and <hi>Vegetative,</hi> and are common to us with <hi>Brute-Beasts</hi> and <hi>Plants.</hi> For <hi>These</hi> are always deaf to the Voice of <hi>Reason</hi> and uncapable of it, and may in some sort be said to derive themselves from <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and to be inseperably attached to the <hi>Body</hi> and devoted to the service thereof; but the <hi>Other Sensual</hi> Part subject to the sudden <hi>Efforts</hi> of the <hi>Passions</hi> and destitute of any <hi>Reason</hi> of its own, is yet nevertheless naturally adapted to hear and obey the <hi>Intellect</hi> and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:46328:222"/>
                  <hi>Judgment,</hi> to have regard to it, and to submit it self to be regulated and ordered according to the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> thereof, unless it happen to be utterly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and vitiated by <hi>Pleasure,</hi> which is deaf to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and by a <hi>luxurious</hi> way of <hi>Living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for those who wonder how it should come to pass, that, that which is <hi>Irrational</hi> it self, should yet become obsequious to the dictates of <hi>Right Reason,</hi> they seem to me, not to have duely considered the <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> how great and extensive it is, and how far it is able to carry and extend it's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and command, not so much by harsh and Arbitrary methods, as by soft and gentle means, which perswade more, and gain Obedience sooner then all the Severities and Violences in the World. For even the Spirits, the Sinews, Bones, and other parts of the Body, are destitute of <hi>Reason,</hi> but yet no sooner do they feel the least <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> shaking, as it were, (though never so gently) the <hi>Reins of Reason,</hi> but all of them <hi>Observe</hi> their proper Order, agree together and pay a ready Obedience. As for instance, the <hi>Feet,</hi> if the <hi>Impulse</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> be to <hi>run,</hi> immediately betake themselves to their <hi>Office;</hi> Or if the <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> be, for the <hi>throwing</hi> or <hi>lifting</hi> up of any thing, the <hi>Hands</hi> in a moment fall to their <hi>business.</hi> And this <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Brutal Faculties</hi> to <hi>Right Reason,</hi> and the ready Conformity of them thereto <hi>Homer</hi> has most admirably exprest in these Verses.</p>

And then the <hi>decision</hi> of these Disputes belongs to <hi>Sense</hi> which is equally affected with both the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other;</hi> and <hi>which</hi> soever of them gets the Mastery, the <hi>other</hi> is not thereby destroyed, but, (thÃ´ struggling and resisting all the while) forced only to comply and go along with the <hi>Conqueror.</hi> As an <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Person for Example, finding himself ingaged in an <hi>Amour</hi> he cannot approve has immediate recourse to his <hi>Reason,</hi> to oppose the Force of that against his <hi>Passion,</hi> as having them <hi>both together</hi> actually subsisting in his Soul, plainly discerning them to be <hi>several</hi> and distinct, and feeling a sensible conflict between the <hi>two,</hi> while he endeavours as it were with his hand to repress and keep down that part which is inflamed and rages so violently within him. But on the contrary in those <hi>deliberations</hi> and disquisitions where the <hi>Passions</hi> have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, <hi>such</hi> I mean as belong properly to the <hi>Contemplative</hi> Part of the Soul, if the Reasons are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ballanced, not inclining more to one side then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, then is there no determinate <hi>Judgment</hi> formed, but there remains a <hi>doubting,</hi> as if there were a <hi>Rest</hi> or <hi>suspense</hi> of the Understanding between two contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:46328:231"/> But if there happen to be any Inclination or Determination towards <hi>one</hi> side, that prevailing must needs get the better of the <hi>other,</hi> but without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret or obstinate opposition from it against the Opinion which is received. In short whenever the contest seems to be of <hi>Reason</hi> against <hi>Reason,</hi> in that case we have no manner of Sense of <hi>two distinct Powers,</hi> but of <hi>one simple uniform Faculty</hi> only, under different Apprehensions or Imaginations; but when the dispute is between the <hi>Irrational</hi> Part and <hi>Reason,</hi> where Nature has so ordered it that neither the Victory nor the Defeat can be had without anxiety and regret, there immediately the <hi>two</hi> contending Powers divide the <hi>Soul</hi> in the Quarrel, and thereby make the <hi>difference</hi> and <hi>distinction</hi> between them to be most plain and evident.</p>
               <p>And not only from their <hi>contests,</hi> but no less also from the <hi>consequences</hi> that follow thereupon, may one clearly enough discern the Sourse and Original of the <hi>Passions</hi> to be <hi>different</hi> from that of <hi>Reason.</hi> For seeing that a Man may set his Affection upon an <hi>ingenuous</hi> and vertuously disposed Child, and no less also upon one that is <hi>naughty</hi> and dissolute; and seeing also one may have unreasonable and indecent <hi>transports</hi> of Anger against his <hi>Children</hi> or his <hi>Parents;</hi> and on the contrary may justly and unblamably be <hi>Angry</hi> in their Defence against their Enemies and <hi>Tyrants;</hi> as in the <hi>one</hi> case there is perceived a struggle and dispute of the <hi>Passions</hi> against <hi>Reason,</hi> so in the <hi>other</hi> may be seen a ready submission and agreement of them, running to it's Assistance, and lending as it were their helping hand. To illustrate this with a familiar Example, after a <hi>Good Man</hi> has in Obedience to the Laws Married a <hi>convenient</hi> Wife, he then in the first place comes to a resolution of conversing and cohabiting with her wisely and honestly, and of making at least a <hi>civil Husband,</hi> but in process of time, Custom and constant Familiarity having bred within

               <p>MOst People are apt to take the Histories of former Times for mere Forgeries and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, because of many Passages in those Relations that seem to be very extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant. But yet according to my Observation, we have had as strange Occurrences of a later Date, as any we have received from Antiquity; for proof whereof I have here match'd several Stories of the <hi>Ancients</hi> with <hi>modern</hi> Instances, and cited my Authorities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Datis,</hi> an eminent <hi>Persian</hi> Commander, drew out three hundred thousand Men to <hi>Marathon,</hi> a Plain of <hi>Attica,</hi> where he encamped, and denounced War to the Inhabitants. The <hi>Athenians</hi> made no Reckoning at all of so barbarous a Rabble, but sent out nine thousand Men against him, under the Command of <hi>Cynaegyrus, Polyzelus, Callimachus,</hi> and <hi>Miltiades.</hi> Upon the joyning
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:46328:239"/> of Battle, <hi>Polyzelus</hi> was struck blind at the Sight of a wonderful Apparition: <hi>Callimachus</hi> his Body was struck thorow with a great many Lances, continuing in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Posture even when he was dead: <hi>Cynaegyrus</hi> had both his Hands cut off upon laying hold of a <hi>Persian</hi> Ship that was endeavoring to get away.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> having possest himself of <hi>Sicily,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd War against the <hi>Romans. Metellus,</hi> who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Senate to command in chief, overcame him. <hi>L. Glauco,</hi> a <hi>Patrician,</hi> laid hold of the Vessel that <hi>Asdrubal</hi> was in, and lost both his Hands upon it. <hi>Aristides Milesius</hi> gives this Account in his first Book of the Affairs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> had it from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xerxes</hi> march'd with an Army of five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men to <hi>Artemisium,</hi> and declar'd war against the Country. The <hi>Athenians</hi> in a very great Surprise, sent <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> to discover the Motions of the Enemy, notwithstanding a Dream of his Father <hi>Neocles,</hi> that his Son had lost both his Hands. This <hi>Agesilaus</hi> put himself in a <hi>Persian</hi> Habit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the <hi>Barbarians</hi> Camp; where, taking <hi>Mardonius</hi> (an Officer of the Kings Guards) for <hi>Xerxes</hi> himself, he kill'd him: Whereupon he was immediately seiz'd, bound, and carry'd to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who was just then about to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice an Ox to the Sun: The Fire was kindled upon the Altar, and <hi>Agesilaus</hi> put his Right Hand into it, without so much as shrinking at the Pain. He was order'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this to be unty'd; and told the King, that the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians were all of the same Resolution,</hi> and that if he pleas'd, he should see him burn his Left Hand too. This gave <hi>Xerxes</hi> an Apprehension of him, so that he caus'd him to be still kept in Custody. This I find in <hi>Agatharchides,</hi> the <hi>Samian,</hi> in the second Book of his <hi>Persian</hi> History.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Porsena,</hi> a King of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> encamp'd himself beyond the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and made War upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> cutting off the Supplies, till they were brought to a great Want of Provisions. The Senate were at their Wits end what to do, till <hi>Mutius,</hi> a Noble-Man, got leave of the <hi>Consuls,</hi> to take four hundred of his own Quality to advise with upon the Matter. <hi>Mutius,</hi> upon this, put himself into the Habit of a private Man, and cross'd the River; where finding one of the King's Officers giving Orders for the Distribution of Necessaries to the Souldiers, and taking him for the King himself, he slew him. He was taken immediately, and carried to the King, where he put his Right Hand into a Fire that was in the Room, and with a Smile in the middle of his Torments, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> says he, <hi>I can set my self at Liberty without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you leave, and be it known to you, that I have left four hundred Men in the Camp as daring as my self, that have sworn your Death.</hi> This struck <hi>Porsena</hi> with such a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that he made Peace with the <hi>Romans</hi> upon it. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristides Milesius</hi> is my Author for this, in the Third Book of his History.</p>
               <p>There happen'd a Dispute betwixt the <hi>Argives</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> about a Claim to the Possession of <hi>Thyrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> The <hi>Amphictiones</hi> gave their Opinion for a Tryal of it by Battel, so many and so many of a Side, and the Possession to go to the Victor. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> made choice of <hi>Othryades</hi> for their Captain, and the <hi>Argives</hi> of <hi>Thersander.</hi> The Battel was fought, and the only two Survivers that appear'd, were <hi>Agenor</hi> and <hi>Chromius,</hi> both <hi>Argives,</hi> who carry'd their Principals the News of the Victory. In this Interim, <hi>Othryades,</hi> who was not as yet quite dead, made a shift to raise himself by the help of broken Lances; gather'd the Shields of the Dead toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and erected a Trophee with this Inscription upon it in his own Blood, <hi>[To Jupiter, the Guardian of Trophees.]</hi> The Controversie still depended, till the <hi>Amphictiones</hi>
                  <pb n="472" facs="tcp:46328:240"/> upon an ocular Examination of the Matter, gave it for the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> This is according to <hi>Chrysermus</hi> in his Third Book of the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> History.</p>
               <p>In a War that the <hi>Romans</hi> had with the <hi>Samnites,</hi> they made <hi>Posthumius Albinus</hi> their General. He was surpriz'd in a difficult Pass call'd <hi>Furcae Caudinae,</hi> where he was hemm'd in, and lost Three Legions, he himself likewise falling upon the Place grievously wounded. In the Dead of the Night, finding himself near his End, he gather'd together the Targets of his dead Enemies, and raised a Trophee with them, which he inscribed with his Hand dipt in Blood, [<hi>Erected by the</hi> Romans <hi>to</hi> Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Guardian of the Trophees, for a Victory over the</hi> Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.] But <hi>Fabius Gurges,</hi> that was dispatch'd away with Troops under his Command, so soon as he came to the Place, and saw the Trophee, took up an auspicious Omen upon it, fought the Enemy, and overcame them, took their King Prisoner, and sent him to <hi>Rome.</hi> This is in the Third Book of <hi>Aristides Milesius</hi> his <hi>Italian</hi> History.</p>
               <p>Upon the <hi>Persians</hi> falling into <hi>Greece</hi> with a Body of five hundred thousand Men, the <hi>Spartans</hi> sent out <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> with a Party of three hundred Souldiers to secure the Pass of the <hi>Thermopilae.</hi> As they were at Dinner, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> fell in upon them; upon which, <hi>Leonidas</hi> bade them eat heartily, for they were to sup in another World. <hi>Leonidas</hi> charg'd in the Head of his Men into the Body of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and after many Wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, got up to <hi>Xerxes</hi> himself, and took his Crown from his Head. He lost his Life in the Attempt, and <hi>Xerxes</hi> causing him to be cut up when he was dead, found his Heart all hairy. <hi>Aristides,</hi> in the First Book of his <hi>Persian</hi> History.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Punick</hi> War the <hi>Romans</hi> sent out three hundred Men under the Command of <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> where they were all lost, and he himself, after he had receiv'd
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:46328:240"/> a mortal Wound, assaulted <hi>Hannibal,</hi> tore his Diadem from his Head, and died in the Action, according to <hi>Aristides Milesius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a terrible Earth-quake, with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eruption of Water, at <hi>Celaenae,</hi> a City of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> that swallow'd up a great many Houses, People and all. <hi>Midas</hi> upon this, consults the <hi>Oracle,</hi> which gave him for answer, <hi>That if he would cast into that Gulph the most precious thing that he had in the World, the Earth should close again:</hi> Whereupon he threw in a Mass of Gold and Silver, but never the better. This put it in the Head of <hi>Anchyrus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Midas,</hi> to consider, that the most precious thing in Nature, is the Life and Soul of a Man; so that he went presently and embraced his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Wife <hi>Timothaea,</hi> and mounted his Horse, and leapt into the Abyss: The Earth closs'd upon it, and <hi>Midas</hi> rais'd a golden Altar in the Place, laid his Hand upon it, and dedicated it [TO <hi>JÆ²PITER IDAEÆ²S.</hi>] This Altar becomes Stone at that time of the Year when it was usual to have these Eruptions, and after that Season was over, it was turn'd to Gold again. My Author is <hi>Callisthenes,</hi> in his second Book of <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The River <hi>Tiber,</hi> in it's Course over the <hi>Forum,</hi> open'd a huge Cavity in the Ground, so that a great many Houses were buried in it. This was lookt upon as a Judgment upon the Place, from <hi>Jupiter Tarsius;</hi> who, as the <hi>Oracle</hi> told them, was not to be appeas'd without throwing into it what they held most valuable. So they threw a quantity of Gold and Silver into it. But <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> one of the bravest young Men they had, gave a better Guess at the mind of the <hi>Oracle,</hi> and reflecting upon it, that the Life of a Man was much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than Treasure, took his Horse, and plung'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Gulf, and so redeem'd his Country. <hi>Aristides</hi> in the Fortieth Book of his <hi>Italian</hi> History.</p>

               <p>As several great Captains were making merry with <hi>Polynices,</hi> an Eagle passing by, made a stoop, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up into the Air the Lance of <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> who was one of the Company, and then letting it fall down, it stuck in the Ground, and was turn'd into a Laurel. The next Day, when the Armies were in action, the Earth open'd and swallow'd up <hi>Amphiaraus</hi> with his Chariot, in that very place, where at present the City <hi>Herma</hi> stands, so call'd from that Chariot.

               <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> made War upon <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> the King of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> the <hi>Oracle</hi> promis'd <hi>Aemilius Paulus</hi> the Victory, in case he should erect an Altar in that place where he should see an eminent Man with his Chariot swallow'd up into the Ground. Some three days after, <hi>Valerius Conatus,</hi> a Man of a Divine Spirit, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in a Dream to take the <hi>Pontifical Habit</hi> upon him.

                  <p>In this River grows an Herb resembling <hi>Bugloss;</hi> which the Natives bruise, and keep the Juice very charily.

                  <p>In this River there breeds a certain large Fish, which by the Natives is call'd <hi>Clupaea.</hi> This Fish during the increase of the Moon is white; but all the while the Moon is in the wain it is altogether black: and when it grows over bulky, is as it were stabb'd by its own Fins.

For upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Theives or Robbers the Stone sends forth

For which being haunted by the <hi>Furies,</hi> he threw himself into the River <hi>Baetros,</hi> for that reason call'd <hi>Araxes;</hi> as <hi>Ctesiphon</hi> testifies in his First Book of <hi>Persian Affairs. Araxes</hi> King of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> being at War with his Neighbours the <hi>Persians,</hi> before they came to a Battle, was told by the Oracle that he should win the Victories, if he sacrific'd to the Gods two of the most noble Virgins in his Kingdom. Now he out of his paternal Affection to his Children, spar'd hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> own Daughters, and caus'd two lovely Virgins, the Daughters of one of his Nobility to be laid upon the Altar. Which <hi>Mnesalkes,</hi> the Father of the Victims laying to heart, for a time conceal'd his Indignation, but afterwards, observing his opportunity, kill'd both the Kings Daughters, and then leaving his native Soyl fled into <hi>Scythia.</hi> Which when <hi>Araxes</hi> understood, for grief he threw himself into the River <hi>Halmus,</hi> which then was alter'd, and the River call'd <hi>Araxes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this River grows a Plant which is call'd <hi>Araxa,</hi> which in the Language of the Natives signifies a <hi>Virgin Hater.</hi> For that if it happen to be found by any Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, it falls a bleeding and dyes away.</p>
                  <p>In the same River there is also found a Stone, of a
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:46328:268"/> black color, call'd <hi>Sicyorus.</hi> This Stone when the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle advises the sacrificing of a human Victim, is laid upon the Altar of the Mischief diverting Gods. And then, no sooner does the Priest but touch it with his Knife but it sends forth a stream of Blood; at what time the superstitious sacrificers retire and with howlings and loud Ohonings carry the Stone to the Temple, as <hi>Doritheus</hi> the <hi>Caldaean</hi> relates in his Second Book of <hi>Stones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nere to this River lies the Mountain <hi>Diorphus;</hi> so call'd from <hi>Diorphus,</hi> the Son of the Earth; of whom this Story is reported. <hi>Methras</hi> desirous to have a Son, yet hating Woman-kind,<note n="*" place="margin">Saxum Sarrivit, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of</hi> Martial, Quid Sarrire si velit Saxum?</note> lay with a Stone till he had heated it to that degree, that the Stone grew big, and at the prefix'd time was deliver'd of a Son, call'd <hi>Diorphos,</hi> who growing up and contending with <hi>Mars</hi> for cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and stoutness was by him slain; and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain where the Contender was buried was call'd <hi>Dior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos</hi> by his Name.</p>
                  <p>In this Mountain grows a Tree, not unlike a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate-Tree, which yields plenty of Apples, in taste like Grapes. Now if any one gather the ripest of this Fruit, and do but name <hi>Mars</hi> while he holds it in his hand, it will presently grown green again, as <hi>Ctesiphon</hi> Witnesses in his Third Book of <hi>Trees.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bacchus</hi> falling in Love with the Nymph <hi>Alphesiboea,</hi> and being able to vanquish her neither with Presents nor Intreaties, turn'd himself into the shape of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Tigris</hi> and overcoming his Beloved by fear, took her away, and carrying her over the River, begot a Son whom he call'd <hi>Medus;</hi> who growing up in Years, in remembrance of the accident call'd the River by the Name of <hi>Tigris;</hi> as <hi>Aristonymus</hi> relates in his Third Book.</p>
                  <p>In this River a Stone is to be found call'd <hi>Myndan</hi> very White; which whoever enjoys, shall never be hurt by wild Beasts; as <hi>Leo</hi> of <hi>Byzantium</hi> testifies in his Third Book of <hi>Rivers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nere to this River lies the Mountain <hi>Gauran;</hi> so call'd from <hi>Gauran</hi> the Son of the <hi>Satrap</hi> of the Province of <hi>Roxanes;</hi> who being extreamly Religious and Devout toward the Gods, receiv'd this reward of his Piety, that of all the <hi>Persians</hi> he only liv'd three hundred Years; and dying at last without being ever afflicted with any Disease, was buried upon the Top of the Mountain <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> where he had a sumptuous Monument erected to his Memory.

                  <p>In this Mountain grows an Herb, which is like to Wild-Barley.

                     <hi>Indus</hi> is a River in <hi>India</hi> flowing with a rapid violence into the Country of the Fish-devourers. It was first call'd <hi>Mausolus,</hi> from <hi>Mausolus</hi> the Son of the Sun, but chang'd it's name for this reason.</p>
                  <p>At the time when the Mysteries of <hi>Bacchus</hi> were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniz'd, and that the People were earnest at their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, <hi>Indus</hi> one of the chief of the Young-Nobility, by force deflowr'd <hi>Damasalkidas,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Oxyalcus</hi> the King of the Country, as she was carrying the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred-Basket, or Canistrum; for which being sought for by the Tyrant, in order to bring him to condign Punishment, for fear he threw himself into the River <hi>Mausolus,</hi> which from that accident was afterwards call'd <hi>Indus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this River grows a certain Stone call'd <hi>Carpyce</hi> which if a Virgin carry about her, she need never be afraid of being deflower'd.</p>
                  <p>In the same River also grows an Herb, which is call'd <hi>Carpyce,</hi> not unlike to <hi>Bugloss.</hi> Which is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Remedy against the Kings-Evil, being admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd to the Patient in warm-water; as <hi>Clitophon,</hi> the <hi>Rhodian,</hi> reports in his First Book of <hi>Indian Relations.</hi>

                  <p>In this Mountain a Stone is found which is call'd <hi>Clitoris,</hi> of a very Black-color, which the <hi>Natives</hi> wear for Ornaments-sake, at the solemn sacrifices which they make after their escape from any Danger or Sickness; as <hi>Aristotle</hi> Witnesses in his Fourth Book of <hi>Rivers.</hi>
